## Maintenance rule

This file is the durable project bitácora. After any meaningful Git operation—commit, branch change, pull request action, release/prerelease, CI failure or recovery, packaging change, or important prerelease finding—append/update the relevant section here. Do not rely only on chat history.

## Current repository state

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Current public release at candidate start | `v1.6.1` — FoamLens v1.6.1, normal release |
| Latest stable v1.6.1 merge head | `45d18c43b845fafb45c9497aaa011d92c64d5b8c` — v1.6.1 PR #19 |
| Validated v1.6.1 main head at candidate start | `4c408b3d5d0b75982a1d98504cabeeb47fd4e048` — Windows CI #922 SUCCESS / Store CI #6 SUCCESS |
| Stable v1.6.1 assets | Portable and Setup `v1.6.1.exe`, each with SHA-256 |
| Real regression fixture | `realmichelduarte/QuickCup-Solidification@foamlens-real-fixture-b13` |
| Latest prerelease | `v1.3.0-rc.1` — legacy prerelease retained for history |

## Important project milestones

- **2026-09-24** — repository history begins with `Initial release: OpenFOAM PostPlotter v20`.
- **2026-09-27** — Windows packaging/release line progressed through v1.0.0, v1.0.1, v1.0.2, v1.1.0, v1.2.0, and a published v1.3.0 release on `main`.
- **2026-09-28** — development continued on `development/v1.3.0-general-discovery` for the broader general OpenFOAM v1.3.0 work, with PR #1 opened as a draft against `main`.
- **2026-09-28** — master-spec audit/regression hardening added physical-time playback cache/prefetch, solver corrector + termination parsing, and stronger Windows visual smoke tests.
- **2026-09-28** — `v1.3.0-rc.1` prerelease was published from the development branch with portable EXE, SHA-256, and installer assets.
- **2026-09-28** — prerelease testing exposed UI defects: hidden sidebar lacked an obvious restore affordance and the Cases popover could be covered by navigation. Commit `3ddc9b6` fixed both; Actions run #189 passed.
- **2026-09-28** — prerelease testing exposed a background-execution defect: scanner yields depended on `requestAnimationFrame`, so scientific work could stall when the WebView stopped producing render frames. The pipeline was changed to a render-independent task scheduler and guarded by regression tests; Windows minimized-window smoke validation passed in run #191.
- **2026-09-28** — prerelease review found Watch Run technically functional but too browser-oriented and too sparse for the desktop product. It was upgraded to a read-only live OpenFOAM run monitor with explicit RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED state, physical-time progress, deltaT, Courant, latest residual, coupling/corrector state, execution/clock time, five-second refresh, manual refresh/stop, and a Numerical Performance handoff. Actions run #192 passed.
- **2026-09-28** — Review/Case Auditor identity was hardened after prerelease screenshots showed mixed case selector/health/root state. Commit `fafce7e97fa8d561fe6ba73e8e6b9da8aaf8b600`; Actions run #193 passed.
- **2026-09-28** — native Windows branding was added to the EXE, form/taskbar, installer and shortcuts. Commit `5e1d00de11dce70c34d94959c4bc2c402d058b9b`; Actions run #194 passed.

## How to update this log

When a new change is made, record the actual commit SHA and CI result after the operation completes. When a prerelease bug is found, add it as an open QA item first; move it into the milestone/commit history only after the fix is committed and validated. Releases should record the exact tag, target and generated binary assets.


## 2026-09-28 — v1.3.1 release preparation

- Desktop semantic version bumped from `1.3.0` to `1.3.1` before merging PR #1.
- Reason: the `main` workflow publishes the GitHub Release from the desktop project version; keeping `1.3.0` would overwrite/reuse the existing `v1.3.0` release instead of creating a new patch release.
- Target release after CI + merge: `v1.3.1`.


## 2026-09-28 — FoamLens Desktop v1.3.1 released

- PR #1 (`Release FoamLens Desktop v1.3.1`) was marked ready and merged into `main`.

## 2026-09-29 — v1.3.2 release correction

- GitHub already published normal release `v1.3.1` from merge commit `97060108c7cbed8d06310644195a7c2ee0989562`; Actions run #196 passed.
- Post-release inspection found that the binary still carried internal `development / release candidate` wording even though the functional prerelease QA fixes were included.
- The existing `v1.3.1` artifacts are intentionally not being silently replaced from a different commit. A clean patch release is being prepared instead.
- Branch `release/v1.3.2` was created directly from `main` commit `3735424af6f6413b72fbfe7e101a97040448fa40`.
- v1.3.2 removes development/RC wording, reports frontend `v51` and Desktop `v1.3.2`, stores new workspace payloads as `productVersion: v51`, and updates README/version regressions accordingly.
- CI on release branches is enabled through the `release/**` workflow branch pattern. Actions run #198 completed successfully: real QuickCup regression, complete scientific/UI suites, portable EXE smoke, native icon checks, minimized background execution, installer build and installed-app smoke all passed.

| #198 | 2026-09-29 | `release/v1.3.2` | `ada3a9168610` | success | v1.3.2 release correction; full Windows + QuickCup validation passed. |

- Release published at 2026-09-29 17:28:32 UTC.
- `v1.3.1` was left intact; its assets were not silently replaced.


## 2026-09-29 — v1.4.0 Field View development started

- Development branch: `development/v1.4.0-field-view`, created directly from released `main` v1.3.2 commit `2ab17037bcc6922f25ed2f28d9e2a493a33fa327`.
- Native Desktop bridge extended with read-only, cancellable ASCII OpenFOAM `polyMesh` parsing for `points`, `faces`, `owner`, and `neighbour`.
- Frontend extension loading generalized from `v13-*.js` to `v*-*.js`; the new viewer lives in isolated module `v14-field-view.js` rather than modifying the monolithic v51 frontend.
- Added the **Field View** data tab with WebGL mesh rendering, boundary-surface scalar coloring, mesh edges, camera orbit/zoom, color maps, locked color ranges and physical-time playback.
- Added vector-field visualization with magnitude/component selection, velocity glyphs and configurable streamlines derived from the actual instantaneous cell-centred OpenFOAM vector field.
- Streamlines use local inverse-distance vector interpolation with midpoint integration; this is an explicit FoamLens approximation and is not claimed to reproduce ParaView/VTK interpolation bit-for-bit.
- Added default-region and named-region `constant/polyMesh` discovery.
- Fixed multi-region eligibility so cases such as `metal` / `mold` are visualizable when a meshed named region has compatible volume fields.
- Decomposed processor fields are not silently mapped onto a reconstructed mesh; Field View requests reconstruction when topology/count alignment cannot be established.
- Initial fallback QA exposed and fixed an over-escaped ASCII `points` parser regex (`point-count-mismatch` on a valid cube).
- Initial WebGL QA exposed and fixed a renderer-factory naming typo before release.
- Dedicated regression: `desktop/tests/field-view.test.cjs` validates a synthetic OpenFOAM cube, region discovery, multi-region availability, physical-time navigation, colormaps, streamline integration, native bridge wiring, vector/streamline product wiring and generic versioned module loading.
- Real QuickCup regression remains green, but the QuickCup fixture repository does not version `polyMesh`; therefore mesh geometry itself is currently regression-tested with the synthetic OpenFOAM fixture. QuickCup's `controlDict` uses `writeFormat ascii`, matching the supported mesh format.
- Validation progression:
  - Run #200: failed only in the new Field View cube parser.
  - Run #201: failed on the same fallback parser after the separate renderer typo was fixed.
  - Run #202: success after fixing ASCII point parsing.
  - Runs #203 and #204: success with vector glyphs and their regression coverage.
  - Run #206: **success** after the multi-region fix and dedicated multi-region test; real QuickCup regression, all legacy suites, Field View suite, portable EXE smoke, installer build and installed-app smoke all passed.
- Final validated code SHA for run #206: `919131e08b4edaa65e458bcbf955b73f06c62847`.
- Documentation-only scope record added afterward in `docs/v1.4.0-field-view-spec.md`; no release was published and `main` remains v1.3.2.


### 2026-09-29 — v1.4.0 development packaging and final Field View validation

- Branch-only Desktop version advanced to `1.4.0` so development artifacts are not mislabeled as the stable v1.3.2 release.
- v1.4 uses an isolated local app-bundle root (`FoamLens/Desktop/1.4.0/app`); the public `main` release remains v1.3.2.
- The version overlay identifies this branch as `Desktop v1.4.0 development` while the retained v51 base remains release-clean.
- Added vector glyphs derived from the actual cell-centred vector field, alongside streamlines.
- Fixed Field View availability for named multi-regions such as `metal` / `mold`.
- Fixed colormap legend synchronization so Viridis, Turbo and cool–warm legends match the colors actually rendered on the mesh.
- Run #211 validated the complete v1.4.0 development build identity, full scientific/UI suites, real QuickCup regression, portable EXE smoke, installer and installed-app smoke.
- Runs #212/#213 validated the colormap legend correction.
- **Final validation: GitHub Actions run #213 — success.**
- Final tested head: `c3cd5651e99211a4af4168fb8ecac063bcbf0f41`.
- Run #213 artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.0` (artifact id `11058631160`).
- No GitHub Release was published and `main` was not modified.

## 2026-09-29 — v1.4.1 post-release hotfix + thesis-analysis expansion

Branch: `fix/v1.4.1-field-view-discovery` (created from released `main` v1.4.0).

### Field View hotfix
- Fixed versioned frontend extension injection so v14 modules are inserted inside the main FoamLens frontend IIFE rather than an unrelated inner/later IIFE.
- Field View remains discoverable even when no compatible 3D dataset is available and reports the missing requirement instead of disappearing.
- Added Overview quick access to 3D Field View.
- Added packaged-executable smoke validation for the actual mounted Field View UI.
- Final Field View smoke path validated in the portable and installed Desktop build.

### Sidebar UX
- Added persistent collapsible/expandable sidebar sections.
- Section state is stored locally and restored across sessions.
- Case-management-heavy content is compactable so it no longer dominates the working sidebar.

### Smart Import version grouping
- Detected case/version groups are exposed in Smart Import.
- Users can select/deselect a detected version group in one action while preserving per-case selection.

### Dual-variable Time-Series Focus
- Added optional second simultaneous variable for time-series comparison.
- Supports independent left/right Y axes for quantities with different units (for example temperature and liquid fraction).
- Existing single-variable workflow remains valid.

### Formal convergence audit
- Added explicit linear-solver and PIMPLE/nonlinear coupling evidence.
- Keeps same-solve initial→final residual convergence separate from cross-outer coupling convergence.
- Adds formal coupling-ratio metrics and regression coverage.

### Automatic momentum mechanism audit
- Detects mapped Darcy, buoyancy and pressure-gradient acceleration fields generically.
- Calculates per-cell magnitude statistics and local mechanism ratios.
- Reports median/P95/fraction > 1 and excluded near-zero denominators.
- Can create physical-time evolution curves without temporal extrapolation.
- Does not convert ratios into causal/mechanism verdicts.

### postProcessing provenance correction
- Multi-column OpenFOAM reductions now preserve per-column identity instead of assigning every column the field inferred from the filename.
- `sum(energyFlux)`, `sum(heatFlux)`, `volIntegrate(h)`, etc. preserve operation + field metadata.
- Parsed function-object metadata now includes `operation`, `weightField`, `patch`, `patches` and `cellZone`.

### Automatic Energy Audit
- Added automatic detection of OpenFOAM energy-flux decomposition.
- Checks the OpenFOAM v14 identity `energyFlux = energyAdvectiveFlux + heatFlux` over common physical times.
- Reports absolute and relative closure residuals plus integrated advective/diffusive/total/residual energies.
- Detects sensible-energy inventory only when provenance supports a rho-weighted volume integral of specific energy.
- Detects integrated latent-heat power when compatible volume-reduction provenance is present.
- Does not impose an unverified conservation sign convention across boundary/sensible/latent terms.
- Can create derived closure-residual and cumulative-boundary-energy curves.

### Validation
- Run #241: success after per-column postProcessing provenance regression.
- Runs #236–#239: success for automatic momentum mechanism audit and CI wiring.
- Runs #233–#235: success for formal convergence audit and CI wiring.
- Runs #230–#232: success for dual-variable Time-Series Focus and CI wiring.
- Runs #227–#229: success for Smart Import version grouping and CI wiring.
- Runs #224–#226: success for persistent collapsible sidebar sections and CI wiring.
- **Run #244: SUCCESS** at head `64a13fff1b018b986a0e0581b59c9692644d3e1b`.
  - Real QuickCup regression: success.
  - Automatic Energy Audit regression: success.
  - Portable EXE smoke: success.
  - Installer build: success.
  - Installed-app smoke: success.
  - Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.1` (artifact id `11063691879`).
- No GitHub Release was published from the hotfix branch; `main` remains the released v1.4.0 until the branch is intentionally promoted.


## 2026-09-29 — Experimental validation workflow

### Evidence boundary from the thesis project
- The QuickCup project audit explicitly states that the repository **does not currently contain a numeric experimental Quick-Cup thermocouple time series** (CSV/XLSX/raw points).
- Therefore FoamLens does not report experimental RMSE/MAE or event errors from repository data and no synthetic values are treated as thesis results.
- The validation workflow is prepared for a future raw or digitized experimental curve.

### Simulation vs experiment module
- Added `v14-experimental-validation.js`.
- Imports experimental `.csv`, `.txt`, `.dat` and `.tsv` time-temperature tables.
- Supports comma, semicolon, tab and whitespace delimiters.
- Semicolon-delimited files with decimal commas are parsed without confusing decimal commas for separators.
- Time and temperature columns are auto-detected but remain explicitly selectable.
- Experimental temperature units can be declared as K or °C.
- Experimental time alignment uses an explicit user-defined time shift; no hidden automatic shift is applied.
- Comparison is restricted to the shared physical-time interval and never extrapolates.
- Reports:
  - RMSE of T(t);
  - MAE of T(t);
  - mean bias (simulation − experiment);
  - maximum absolute temperature difference;
  - Tmin and its time;
  - thermal-rebound candidate amplitude, peak time and maximum positive dT/dt.
- An optional liquid-fraction series provides independent phase evidence:
  - alphaL onset/completion threshold-crossing times;
  - phase-defined solidification duration;
  - liquid-fraction trend during the simulated thermal-rebound candidate.
- A positive dT/dt interval is **not** automatically labelled recalescence. Phase evidence is displayed separately as solidifying, remelting, approximately stationary or unavailable.
- Can add the aligned experimental temperature curve and ΔT(sim−exp) residual to the standard Time-Series plot.

### Regression and packaging
- Run #247 exposed an actual delimiter-detection bug: decimal commas in semicolon CSV files biased the first implementation toward comma separation.
- Fixed delimiter detection to prefer a consistent tabular column count across sampled rows.
- **Run #248: SUCCESS** at code head `5854f4dcc5cbcd3b32e600ef772aa3c773bc2dd2`.
  - Simulation-vs-experiment regression: success.
  - Real QuickCup regression: success.
  - All previous Field View/sidebar/import/convergence/momentum/energy regressions: success.
  - Portable EXE smoke: success.
  - Installer build: success.
  - Installed-app smoke: success.
  - Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.1` (artifact id `11063823771`).
- No GitHub Release was published; this remains on the v1.4.1 hotfix/development branch.


## 2026-09-29 — Field View interior slice reconstruction

### Mesh topology
- Extended the native OpenFOAM ASCII `polyMesh` result with full volumetric connectivity:
  - flattened face-point indices;
  - face offsets;
  - owner labels;
  - neighbour labels.
- The browser fallback parser exposes the same connectivity, so native and web paths share the same slice algorithm.

### Interior Slice
- Added a real interior slice reconstruction to Field View rather than a near-plane cell-centre point filter.
- Reconstructs point values from adjacent cell-centred values using inverse-distance weighting.
- Decomposes each polyhedral cell into tetrahedra formed by the reconstructed cell centre and triangulated cell faces.
- Intersects those tetrahedra with an arbitrary X/Y/Z plane and interpolates the selected scalar/vector-component values at the intersection vertices.
- Controls added:
  - Show slice;
  - plane normal X/Y/Z;
  - normalized plane position;
  - slice opacity.
- Slice updates with the physical-time playback, selected field/component and current colormap/range.
- When a slice is active the boundary surface is rendered as translucent contextual geometry without depth-writing over the interior cut.
- The UI explicitly states that the cell-to-point reconstruction/tetrahedralization is not claimed to be bit-identical to ParaView/VTK.

### Validation
- Synthetic unit-cube regression checks a plane at `x=0.37`:
  - every slice vertex lies on the requested plane;
  - a uniform cell value remains uniform on the slice;
  - reconstructed cross-sectional area is 1.0.
- Native parser regression verifies full face/owner/neighbour connectivity is exported.
- Field View regression verifies slice controls and WebGL buffers remain wired.
- **Run #253: SUCCESS** at code head `ef6506953af2bd9484542ffa99e71ec87bcdb5a4`.
  - Field View/slice regression: success.
  - Real QuickCup regression: success (QuickCup repository still does not track a polyMesh fixture, so the actual thesis mesh is not represented by this fixture).
  - Portable EXE smoke: success.
  - Installer build: success.
  - Installed-app smoke: success.
  - Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.1` (artifact id `11063484823`).
- No GitHub Release was published from this branch.


## 2026-09-29 — Field View iso-surface / contour reconstruction

### Iso-surface
- Added a reconstructed 3D iso-surface / contour layer to Field View for the currently selected scalar or vector component.
- Uses the same volumetric reconstruction basis as interior slices:
  - cell-centred values;
  - inverse-distance cell-to-point reconstruction;
  - polyhedral cell tetrahedralization.
- Extracts the constant-value surface with marching tetrahedra.
- Removes duplicate reconstructed triangles by tolerance-based geometric keys and rejects degenerate triangles.
- User controls:
  - Show iso-surface;
  - explicit iso value (default `0.5`);
  - opacity;
  - use-current-midrange helper.
- For liquid fraction, `alphaL = 0.5` can be viewed directly as a mid-front contour; temperature can use an explicitly selected isotherm.
- Iso-surfaces update with:
  - physical-time playback;
  - selected field/component;
  - color map;
  - locked/unlocked display range.
- When an interior slice or iso-surface is active, the external boundary surface is rendered as translucent context rather than depth-occluding the interior geometry.
- FoamLens explicitly describes the reconstruction as marching tetrahedra on reconstructed cell-centred data and does not claim bit-identical ParaView/VTK output.

### Regression
- Dedicated test: `desktop/tests/isosurface.test.cjs`.
- Analytic tetrahedron regression verifies a linear scalar field produces the expected `phi = 0.5` plane and triangle area.
- Four-edge tetrahedron intersections are triangulated into finite non-degenerate triangles.
- Out-of-range iso values produce no geometry.
- Product wiring regression verifies controls, WebGL iso buffers and physical-time update hooks.

### Validation
- **GitHub Actions run #260: SUCCESS**.
- Validated head: `1b0acb91076a55bd7bca9dde2b450c83c5c51619`.
- Real QuickCup regression: success.
- Field View + iso-surface regression: success.
- All previous sidebar/import/dual-series/convergence/momentum/energy/experimental-validation suites: success.
- Portable EXE smoke: success.
- Installer build: success.
- Installed-app smoke: success.
- Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.1` (artifact id `11068679330`).
- No GitHub Release was published from the hotfix branch.


## 2026-09-29 — 3D Field View probe / picking

### Probe interaction
- Added a dedicated 3D probe mode to Field View.
- Clicking rendered geometry performs a true 3D ray cast against the triangles currently represented by FoamLens rather than selecting the nearest screen pixel.
- Supported pick targets:
  - boundary surface;
  - interior slice;
  - iso-surface.
- Boundary-surface picks resolve the exact owner cell and report that cell-centred field value.
- Slice picks use barycentric interpolation of the reconstructed slice vertex values.
- Iso-surface picks report the selected constant iso value.
- For reconstructed interior geometry, FoamLens also reports the nearest cell explicitly as an approximation; it is labelled as nearest rather than presented as an exact containing-cell lookup.
- Probe readout reports:
  - source geometry;
  - selected field;
  - value and inferred unit;
  - physical time;
  - X/Y/Z;
  - cell / nearest-cell identity when available.
- A 3-axis marker is rendered at the picked 3D location.
- Pointer-drag motion is separated from clicking so orbiting the camera does not accidentally create a probe.
- Probe state is cleared whenever the displayed physical-time frame/field changes so FoamLens never leaves a stale value from a previous timestep on screen.

### Numerical implementation
- Canvas coordinates are unprojected through the inverse current model-view-projection matrix.
- Ray / triangle intersection uses Möller–Trumbore geometry.
- Slice scalar values are interpolated with barycentric coordinates.
- When several triangles lie along the ray, the nearest positive intersection is selected.

### Regression
- Dedicated test: `desktop/tests/field-probe.test.cjs`.
- Validates:
  - 4×4 matrix inversion on identity;
  - a known ray/triangle intersection;
  - barycentric interpolation;
  - nearest-hit selection;
  - iso constant-value picking;
  - rejection of parallel/outside rays;
  - UI controls and WebGL marker-buffer wiring;
  - fixture-name neutrality.

### Validation
- **GitHub Actions run #264: SUCCESS**.
- Validated head: `4d481d8a4c33a4783e2b677d4937ced121990472`.
- Real QuickCup regression: success.

- Installed-app smoke: success.
- Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.1` (artifact id `11069760533`).

## 2026-09-30 — Field View iso-surfaces / contours

### 3D iso-surface reconstruction
- Added reconstructed constant-value surfaces to Field View through `v14-isosurface.js`.
- Uses marching tetrahedra over the same volumetric reconstruction used by Interior Slice:
  - cell-centred field values;
  - adjacent-cell inverse-distance point reconstruction;
  - cell-centre tetrahedralization;
  - edge interpolation at the requested iso value.
- Does not approximate an iso-surface by merely selecting nearby cell centres.
- Controls added:
  - Show iso-surface;
  - numeric iso value;
  - opacity;
  - Use current midrange.
- Typical thesis use:
  - liquid fraction `alphaL = 0.5` to inspect a mid solidification front;
  - an explicitly selected temperature to inspect an isotherm.
- Iso-surfaces update during physical-time playback and use the current field, component, colormap and locked/display range.
- Surface geometry becomes translucent when an interior slice or iso-surface is active so the interior visualization remains visible.
- Implementation remains explicit that reconstruction is not claimed to be bit-identical to ParaView/VTK.

### Regression
- Added a marching-tetrahedra linear-field regression:
  - tetrahedron vertices with scalar values `[0,1,1,1]`;
  - requested iso `0.5`;
  - reconstructed triangle lies exactly on `x+y+z=0.5`;
  - expected triangle area is `sqrt(3)/8`.
- Run #266 exposed a test-harness error only (`near` helper missing); the geometry implementation itself was not the failing assertion.
- Fixed the regression helper without changing the iso algorithm.
- **Run #267: SUCCESS** at head `3efeeb81617b42ba7bf7e8a47f4b9c0f3ead1f6c`.

## 2026-09-30 — Strict 3D difference field comparison

### Difference view
- Extended synchronized side-by-side 3D case comparison with an optional third viewport for a signed difference field.
- Difference definition is explicit: `Δ = Primary − Comparison`.
- Difference visualization uses a symmetric cool–warm range around zero.
- The same resolved physical-time synchronization used by side-by-side comparison is preserved.
- FoamLens refuses to calculate a 3D difference unless meshes are topologically and geometrically equivalent.
- Compatibility checks include:
  - point count;
  - face count;
  - cell count;
  - internal/boundary face count;
  - point coordinates within a geometry-scaled tolerance;
  - face offsets;
  - face-point connectivity;
  - owner labels;
  - neighbour labels.
- FoamLens does not subtract unrelated meshes merely because they happen to have the same number of cells.
- If compatibility fails, the UI reports the mismatch reason rather than displaying a false difference.

### Regression
- Added `desktop/tests/field-compare.test.cjs`.
- Regression checks:
  - identical meshes accepted;
  - moved geometry rejected;
  - changed connectivity rejected;
  - signed difference follows Primary − Comparison;
  - absolute-difference helper remains numerically correct;
  - color range remains symmetric around zero;
  - third viewport and compatibility wiring remain present.
- Added dedicated CI step: `Test strict 3D difference field comparison`.
- **Run #270: SUCCESS** at head `efd8ca7669d819f689f0ca96b00950911a94ce61`.
  - Real QuickCup regression: success.
  - 3D Field View regression: success.

## 2026-09-30 — Volume-weighted polyhedral cell centroids

### Geometry precision
- Replaced the previous mean-of-face-centres cell location approximation in both the native Desktop polyMesh parser and the JavaScript fallback.
- Cell centres are now calculated as volume-weighted polyhedral centroids using signed tetrahedral integration.
- OpenFOAM face orientation is respected:
  - stored internal-face orientation is outward for the owner cell and reversed for the neighbour cell;
  - boundary faces retain their stored outward orientation.
- A local mean-face-centre reference is used only for numerical stability; it does not define the final centroid.
- Degenerate cells fall back explicitly to the previous mean-face-centre reference rather than returning invalid coordinates.
- `CellCenterMethod` now reports:
  - `volume-weighted-polyhedral`; or
  - `volume-weighted-polyhedral-with-mean-face-fallback:N` when a fallback was required.
- This improves the geometric basis used by vector glyph placement, streamline interpolation, interior slices, iso-surfaces and 3D picking.

### Regression
- Added an asymmetric square-pyramid regression whose exact centroid is `(0, 0, 0.75)`.
- The former mean-face-centres method would place the same cell at `z = 0.8`, so the test distinguishes the new method from the old approximation.
- Unit-cube mesh parsing and all existing Field View regressions remain green.
- **Run #273: SUCCESS** at head `ba28cdb7af0669dcfe97bda5ef03683676b1ab78`.
  - Real QuickCup regression: success.
  - 3D Field View regression: success.

## 2026-09-30 — Native binary OpenFOAM polyMesh support

### Binary mesh parser
- Extended the Desktop-native `parseOpenFOAMMesh` path from ASCII-only text reads to byte-oriented mesh parsing.
- ASCII and binary now converge into one common topology/geometry builder so validation, volume-weighted centroids, boundary triangulation and edge extraction cannot diverge by file format.
- Supported native binary layouts:
  - contiguous point/vector lists;
  - contiguous `owner` / `neighbour` label lists;
  - OpenFOAM `faceCompactList` binary faces represented by offsets + flattened labels.
- Reads optional OpenFOAM `arch` metadata for:
  - LSB / MSB endianness;
  - 32/64-bit labels;
  - 32/64-bit scalars.
- A 64-bit label that cannot fit FoamLens' current in-memory integer indexing is rejected explicitly instead of truncating.
- For binary headers without `arch`, FoamLens uses the common LSB / label32 / scalar64 ABI and reports the format as `binary-lsb-label32-scalar64-assumed` rather than hiding the assumption.
- Unsupported/unknown binary face layouts are rejected with an explicit reason.
- Browser/JavaScript fallback intentionally remains ASCII-only; binary support is a Desktop-native capability.

### Native smoke regression
- Added an in-process binary polyMesh self-test executed on every Desktop smoke run.
- The fixture is a real byte-level one-cell cube using:
  - `format binary`;
  - `arch "LSB;label=32;scalar=64"`;
  - `vectorField` points;
  - `faceCompactList` faces;
  - binary `labelList` owner/neighbour.
- The production parser must recover 8 points, 6 faces, 1 cell and centroid `(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)`.
- Because the self-test runs inside `--smoke-test`, it validates both the portable EXE and the installed EXE.
- **Run #277: SUCCESS** at head `83e1146baba23eb3bdf4a29d0f57e9a9d58c435b`.
  - Real QuickCup regression: success.
  - Full Field View suite: success.
  - Native binary mesh self-test in portable EXE: success.
  - Portable EXE smoke: success.
  - Installer build: success.
  - Native binary mesh self-test in installed EXE: success.
  - Installed-app smoke: success.
  - Windows artifact upload: success.
- No GitHub Release was published from the hotfix/development branch.


## 2026-09-30 — Time-varying / dynamic OpenFOAM mesh playback

### Dynamic mesh discovery
- Extended Field View mesh discovery beyond `constant/[region/]polyMesh` to recognize `<time>/[region/]polyMesh` snapshots.
- Supports the common moving-mesh case where a timestep writes only `points` while `faces`, `owner` and `neighbour` remain inherited from the previous valid topology.
- Supports topology-changing snapshots when a later physical time writes replacement topology components.
- Mesh state resolution is causal in physical time: FoamLens selects the most recent valid mesh state with `t_mesh <= t_field`; it never borrows a future mesh state.
- If no complete `constant/polyMesh` exists, FoamLens requires a complete same-time dynamic snapshot before inheritance begins. Partial files from unrelated earlier times are not combined to fabricate a mesh basis.
- Legacy v1.4.0 static mesh inventories remain compatible and are interpreted as static constant meshes.

### Playback and geometry synchronization
- Field playback now resolves mesh geometry before loading each transient field frame.
- When the resolved mesh snapshot changes, FoamLens rebuilds:
  - boundary surface geometry;
  - mesh edges;
  - volume-weighted cell centroids;
  - spatial hash used by vector interpolation;
  - slice / iso-surface geometry state;
  - 3D probe state;
  - streamline/vector geometry on the refreshed mesh.
- User camera orientation/zoom is preserved across dynamic-mesh playback rather than reset on every geometry change.
- The time readout/status explicitly reports the active mesh state (`constant` or mesh physical time).
- Native ASCII/binary polyMesh parsing is reused for dynamic snapshots; browser fallback remains ASCII-only as documented.

### Regression
- Added `desktop/tests/dynamic-mesh.test.cjs`.
- Coverage verifies:
  - constant and time-directory polyMesh discovery;
  - points-only moving meshes inheriting constant topology;
  - topology replacement at the correct physical time;
  - strict rejection of future mesh geometry;
  - complete-basis requirement when constant mesh is absent;
  - 3D readiness only when at least one field time has a valid mesh state;
  - playback wiring preserves camera while geometry changes.
- Run #284 exposed a backward-compatibility regression in the existing synthetic/static mesh inventory test.
- Fixed legacy `complete:true` inventories to resolve as static constant meshes.

### Validation

## 2026-09-30 — v1.4.1 candidate final reconciliation

### Requested UX/features closed
- Smart Import groups detected cases by version and supports group select/deselect while preserving per-case control.
- Large case-management block is moved to the end of the sidebar at runtime and is collapsed by default.
- Sidebar sections are individually collapsible/expandable with persistent state.
- Time-Series Focus supports an optional second simultaneous variable with independent left/right Y axes.
- Field View is always discoverable, has an Overview quick action and reports missing 3D prerequisites instead of disappearing.

### Thesis/scientific-analysis gaps closed
- Formal linear-solver vs PIMPLE/nonlinear convergence audit.
- Automatic momentum-mechanism audit.
- Automatic OpenFOAM energy audit with provenance and closure checks.
- Simulation-vs-experiment validation with RMSE/MAE/bias and independent phase evidence.
- Dual temperature/liquid-fraction plotting for coupled solidification inspection.
- 3D slices, iso-surfaces, probe picking, synchronized case comparison and strict signed difference fields.
- Volume-weighted polyhedral cell centroids.
- Native ASCII/binary polyMesh support.
- Time-varying/dynamic mesh playback synchronized causally in physical time.

### Remaining explicit non-blocking boundaries
- 3D Field View renders cell-, internal-face-, and point-associated scalar/vector fields with explicit association semantics. `surface*Field` boundary-patch values remain unrendered until explicit `polyMesh/boundary` patch topology and per-patch values are preserved; FoamLens does not fabricate them.
- Browser fallback remains ASCII-only for polyMesh; native Desktop supports binary.
- FoamLens streamline and reconstructed slice/iso algorithms are documented approximations and are not claimed bit-identical to ParaView/VTK.
- The QuickCup repository does not version its actual polyMesh, so real thesis-mesh rendering cannot be CI-regressed from that repository; real QuickCup fields/postProcessing are still regression-tested.

### Documentation reconciliation
- Updated Field View specification from the obsolete first-v1.4 slice to the actual v1.4.1 candidate capability set.
- Desktop README now distinguishes the public v1.4.0 release from the v1.4.1 candidate.
- Root README corrected from stale Desktop v1.3.2 to public v1.4.0 and documents the validated v1.4.1 candidate features.

### Final candidate validation

- v1.4.1 has **not** been published as a GitHub Release yet.


## 2026-09-30 — Field View point / internal-face field associations

### Association-aware 3D rendering
- Extended Field View beyond cell-centred `vol*Field` data without converting other associations into fake cell values.
- The field selector now exposes the association explicitly:
  - **Cell** for `vol*Field`;
  - **Face (internalField)** for `surface*Field`;
  - **Point** for `point*Field`.
- `point*Field` values are rendered directly on the actual mesh vertices used by each boundary triangle.
- `surface*Field internalField` values are rendered on the actual internal mesh faces. Internal polygonal faces are triangulated for WebGL while retaining the exact source face identity.
- At run #297, the external boundary still remained neutral/translucent because explicit `boundaryField` patch values were not yet mapped. This limitation was subsequently closed and validated in run #310 (see the later surfaceField boundary-patch section); FoamLens never substituted owner-cell values or fabricated boundary-face data.
- Association-specific size checks are enforced against:
  - cell count for volume fields;
  - internal-face count for surface fields;
  - point count for point fields.
- A mismatch produces an explicit field/mesh association-count error.

### Interior analysis and vectors
- Interior Slice and Iso-surface remain explicitly cell-centred-volume operations.
- Selecting a Face or Point field disables/clears those controls rather than silently coercing the data to cells.
- Iso-surface code contains its own independent volume-association guard so programmatic calls cannot bypass the UI restriction.
- Vector glyphs and streamlines remain based on a `volVectorField`; Face/Point vector fields are available for direct coloring/components but are not silently used as cell-centred streamline input.

### Association-aware 3D Probe
- Volume-field boundary picks retain exact owner-cell semantics.
- Point-field boundary picks interpolate the actual point values barycentrically on the hit triangle.
- Surface-field picks ray-cast against the rendered internal-face triangles and return the exact internal face id/value.
- Probe readout reports the field association and the appropriate element identity instead of always presenting every hit as a cell.

### Regression and validation
- Extended the existing Field View and 3D Probe regression suites rather than creating redundant parallel test harnesses.
- Added checks for:
  - direct point-vertex coloring;
  - internal-face triangulation and preserved face identity;
  - Cell / Face / Point selector wiring;
  - association-specific element counts;
  - exact internal-face probe ids;
  - explicit prevention of Face/Point → Cell coercion.
- Run #294 exposed only an overly strict test tolerance on `Float32Array` values (`0.10000000149` vs `0.1`); production rendering was not the failing logic.
- Run #296 exposed only a stale test token from an intermediate helper signature; the final architecture intentionally preserves `fvFieldGroups(..., storage='volume')` as the default contract and requests `'any'` only where the main Field View selector needs all associations.
- **GitHub Actions run #297: SUCCESS** at head `3eb42874d6d3e45c8101024c038e69db0f0bf617`.

## 2026-09-30 — Explicit surfaceField boundary-patch rendering

### Boundary topology and values
- Added native and fallback parsing of `polyMesh/boundary` patch topology.
- Mesh results now preserve patch name/type plus exact `startFace` / `nFaces` ranges and boundary-triangle face identities.
- Native ASCII OpenFOAM field parsing now preserves explicit `boundaryField` patch values after parsing `internalField`.
- Supported explicit patch payloads:
  - uniform scalar/vector values;
  - nonuniform scalar/vector lists with strict count validation.
- Patches without an explicit numeric `value` remain unavailable; FoamLens does not substitute owner-cell values or invent patch data.

### Field View
- `surface*Field` now renders:
  - real `internalField` values on internal faces; and
  - explicit patch values on the exact boundary faces defined by `polyMesh/boundary`.
- Missing/symbolic patch values remain neutral context.
- Display range includes explicit boundary values when present.
- Field association readout reports boundary coverage as explicit faces / total boundary faces.
- 3D Probe can resolve an explicitly rendered boundary face and preserve its global face identity / patch association.
- Native Desktop payloads are preferred; ASCII text parsing remains available as fallback.

### Validation
- Dedicated regression: `desktop/tests/surface-boundary.test.cjs`.
- Tests cover exact patch ranges, uniform/nonuniform scalar/vector values, magnitude/components, strict list-count rejection, symbolic/missing values, native payload preservation, fallback parsing and probe/render wiring.
- **GitHub Actions run #310: SUCCESS** at head `ecb5f124ad42071752b1e0bf767193cb89297248`.

## 2026-09-30 — pointField interior Slice / Iso reconstruction

### Association semantics
- Interior Slice and Iso-surface now support both:
  - cell-centred `vol*Field` data; and
  - point-associated `point*Field` data.
- Point-associated reconstruction preserves the actual OpenFOAM point values at mesh vertices.
- Each cell receives only an auxiliary centre value needed for the existing cell-centre tetrahedralization:
  - primary method: 3D affine least-squares reconstruction from the cell's real point values;
  - fallback: inverse-distance weighting only when the local point geometry is rank-deficient / cannot support the affine solve.
- Face-associated `surface*Field` data remains excluded from Interior Slice / Iso; FoamLens does not silently reconstruct face data into a volumetric field.

### Analytic regression
- Added `desktop/tests/point-interior.test.cjs`.
- Synthetic tetrahedron with exact linear point field `phi = x` verifies:
  - reconstructed cell-centre value = 0.25;
  - Slice at `x = 0.5` lies exactly on that plane and interpolates `phi = 0.5`;
  - Slice cross-sectional area = 0.125;
  - Iso-surface `phi = 0.5` reconstructs the same cross-section with area = 0.125.
- Updated the older Field View association contract so Point is explicitly supported for interior reconstruction while Face remains distinct.

### Validation
- **GitHub Actions run #315: SUCCESS** at head `8326ccf3c45d4c0762e6ff9eaaec5b62e7ce9302`.

- No GitHub Release was published from the candidate branch.


## 2026-09-30 — Decomposed surfaceField rendering

- Extended decomposed Field View to surface*Field internal faces and explicit physical boundary patches.
- Internal values are aligned by explicit processor internal-face ranges; missing/extra partitions and count mismatches remain rejected.
- Processor-local physical boundary faces are translated to exact global composite face ids.
- Artificial processor interface patches remain topology-only and are excluded from physical rendering/coverage.
- Run #330 reached the new product checks but failed on a test-only source-file assertion.
- The assertion was corrected without changing product logic.
- **Run #331: SUCCESS** at head `0c86da6b5a7ef0ff125c0d14bcd13aabf720fb09`.
- Real QuickCup regression, decomposed Field View, surface-boundary, dynamic mesh, Slice, Iso, 3D Probe, strict 3D difference, all scientific/UI suites, portable smoke, installer and installed-app smoke: success.
- Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.1` (id `11079714552`, 135239220 bytes).
- No GitHub Release was published from this branch.


## 2026-09-30 — v1.4.1 candidate freeze after decomposed Field View completion

### Requested workflow/UX closure
- Smart Import groups detected cases by version and supports group select/deselect while preserving individual case selection.
- The large case-management card is moved to the end of the sidebar at runtime and defaults collapsed.
- Sidebar cards are individually collapsible/expandable with persistent state.
- Time-Series Focus supports two simultaneous variables with independent left/right Y axes.
- Field View remains discoverable even when 3D prerequisites are missing and is directly accessible from Overview.

### Thesis/post-processing closure
- Formal linear-solver vs PIMPLE/nonlinear convergence audit.
- Automatic momentum-mechanism audit.
- Automatic OpenFOAM energy audit with source provenance and closure checks.
- Simulation-vs-experiment validation with RMSE/MAE/bias and separate phase evidence.
- Association-aware Cell / Face / Point Field View.
- Interior Slice and Iso reconstruction for volume and point fields.
- Vector glyphs, streamlines, 3D probe/picking, synchronized comparison and strict signed difference fields.
- ASCII + native binary polyMesh.
- Dynamic/time-varying mesh playback.
- Processor-decomposed volume, point and surface fields with explicit matching processor mesh states.
- Physical surfaceField boundary patches are mapped to composite global faces; artificial processor-interface patches are excluded from physical rendering and coverage.

### Final product-code validation
- Latest product-code validation: **GitHub Actions run #331 — SUCCESS**.
- Tested product-code head: `0c86da6b5a7ef0ff125c0d14bcd13aabf720fb09`.
- Run #331 artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.1`.

- Dynamic mesh / Slice / Iso / 3D Probe / strict 3D difference regressions: success.
- All scientific/UI regressions: success.

- Installer build + installed-app smoke: success.

### Candidate state
- Commits after the tested product-code head through the current documentation reconciliation are documentation-only.
- No v1.4.1 GitHub Release has been published from this candidate branch.
- Remaining boundaries are explicit/non-blocking rather than missing requested features:
  - browser fallback polyMesh remains ASCII-only while Desktop native supports binary;
  - streamlines and reconstructed Slice/Iso algorithms are documented FoamLens approximations and are not claimed bit-identical to ParaView/VTK;
  - face-associated surfaceField data is not silently converted into a volumetric field for Slice/Iso;
  - the QuickCup repository still does not version its actual thesis polyMesh, so the exact thesis mesh cannot be CI-regressed from that repository.


## 2026-09-30 — Real B13 Solver Logs ingestion defect isolated and fixed

### Real-case evidence
- Full reference case branch: `realmichelduarte/QuickCup-Solidification@foamlens-real-fixture-b13`.
- B13 contains 89 log-like files, including `log.foamMultiRun` and native `foamLog` members such as `logs/p_rgh_0`, `logs/h_0`, and `logs/CourantMax_0`.
- Real `foamLog` time tokens are written with a unit suffix, for example `0.001s` and `0.002s`.

### Root cause
- The JavaScript parser already accepted a leading numeric prefix from tokens such as `0.001s`.
- The Windows native batch parser used `double.TryParse(...)` on the complete token, so `0.001s` was rejected.
- Native parsing therefore returned empty time/value arrays; `solverLogSeriesFromParsed` correctly refused to create zero-length series, leaving the Solver Logs UI at 0 despite the files being present.

### Structural fix
- Branch: `fix/v1.4.2-real-case-ingestion`.
- Commit: `46de7e60b27c410e6c49b9f411fdce5e95b1d049`.
- Native `ParseFoamLogAsync` now uses the same leading-number grammar as the browser parser.
- Added a native executable smoke regression that parses a temporary real-format sample:
  - `0.001s\t0.0062232`
  - `0.002s\t0.0207126`
- The regression validates both parsed time and value arrays and fails the Windows smoke test if suffix handling regresses.

### Validation
- GitHub Actions run #333: **SUCCESS**.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows executable smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build and installed-app smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- GitHub Release publication: **SKIPPED** on the fix branch; no release was duplicated.


## 2026-09-30 — Complete B13 real-case ingestion and UX closure

### Real B13 3D Field View
- Full fixture: `realmichelduarte/QuickCup-Solidification@foamlens-real-fixture-b13`.
- B13 exposes a default/root `constant/polyMesh` plus complete named-region meshes for `metal` and `mold`.
- Its transient scalar/vector fields are associated with named regions, especially `metal` and `mold`.
- Root cause of `3D data unavailable`: Field View previously populated the region selector from every complete mesh and selected the first one. The empty/default mesh region sorted before `metal`/`mold`, so Field View selected a mesh-only region even though the case was globally 3D-capable.
- Structural fix: `fvReadyRegions(caseObj)` is now the shared source of truth for 3D-ready regions. Region selection prefers regions with a complete mesh and compatible scalar/vector field association at a valid mesh time.
- B13 therefore exposes `metal` and `mold` as ready regions instead of opening on the mesh-only default region.
- Product commit: `7062d783a1908bf6c5d274df7d1a1ebc93a033c7`.
- Regression commit: `d815ca59288522e7b3e283103f8908fc6fb082ad`.

### Complete B13 regression fixture
- CI QuickCup fixture checkout now uses branch `foamlens-real-fixture-b13` instead of the older repository `main` fixture state.
- The real integration test explicitly validates complete `metal`/`mold` meshes, `metal/T`, `metal/U`, `mold/T`, and Field View readiness.
- CI fixture commit: `68714a15646346592288507ec122b75d194fa0fe`.
- Real B13 regression passed in runs #335 and #343.

### Time-Series Focus variable-selection regression
- Root cause: the dual-variable extension inserted an empty `All variables` option into Variable 1 and reused the original autoinit/empty-state semantics. Refresh/reset/show-all actions could therefore leave the primary selector empty and disable Variable 2.
- Structural fix:
  - Variable 1 now contains only real detected variables.
  - `tsdPrimaryChoice` preserves an available selection or selects the first real variable.
  - Variable 2 remains optional and excludes the selected primary variable.
  - `Show all variables` is now an explicit button mode rather than an empty primary selection.
  - The button visibly reports the show-all state, and selecting a real primary/secondary variable exits that mode.

### Global sidebar toggle / scrollbar collision
- Root cause: the expanded-state toggle was centered directly on the sidebar boundary with `left: calc(var(--sidebar-w) - 17px)`, overlapping the scroll/resize rail.
- Structural fix:
  - Expanded toggle moved into the sidebar header area with a fixed gap from the right boundary.
  - Brand area reserves space for the control.
  - Collapsed-state fixed reopen control remains reachable at the left edge.

## 2026-09-30 — Global actionable diagnostics + full test-suite audit (v1.4.2 development)

### User-facing diagnostic contract
- FoamLens now treats error/incompatibility reporting as an application-wide contract rather than a per-panel convenience.
- Interactive failures are routed through the shared `flIssueDescriptor / flSetIssue / flClearIssue` system where applicable.
- Actionable diagnostics expose:
  - **Problem** — what operation/input is invalid or unavailable.
  - **Cause** — the detected technical reason/evidence.
  - **Try / Qué cambiar** — the next concrete corrective action.
  - Context when known: analysis/view, field, region, physical time, component, source path and expected input.
- `flSetIssue` also exposes structured metadata on the rendered status element:
  - `data-issue-code`
  - `data-issue-problem`
  - `data-issue-cause`
  - `data-issue-action`
  - corrective action in the element title.
- The diagnostic regression now executes `flSetIssue` / `flClearIssue` against a DOM-like element instead of only checking source strings.

### Analysis/capability visibility
- Flow Analysis, Thermal Analysis, Solidification / Remelting and Physical Analysis no longer disappear merely because their required source data are missing.
- They remain visible and report `analysis-source-missing` with the required input.
- Existing global capability tools (Temporal Alignment, Numerical Performance, Generic Vector Fields) remain visible and diagnostic when unavailable.
- This prevents “missing capability” from being mistaken for “feature does not exist”.

### Silent user actions removed
Previously silent/no-op paths were replaced with actionable diagnostics for:
- Difference Plot selection / missing comparable pair / missing temporal or spatial overlap.
- Smart Import with no selected cases.
- Watch Run read/monitor failures.
- Solver-log playback with insufficient times or sub-iterations.
- Phase Front calculation/export without compatible profiles/results.
- PNG, SVG and CSV export with no visible compatible data.
- Missing Flow/Thermal/Solidification analysis result before export.
- Coupling Audit without case/residual evidence or without enough samples.
- Generic Vector Magnitude refresh failures.
- Iso-surface invalid association, invalid numeric iso value and out-of-range iso value.

### Real B13 Phase/Momentum regression
- Reference fixture: `realmichelduarte/QuickCup-Solidification@foamlens-real-fixture-b13`.
- Real file `B13_prghPressure_airGapOF14/0/metal/alphat` is an ASCII `volScalarField` with `internalField uniform 0;`.
- The real-case regression now verifies:
  - B13 `alphat` remains in the volume-field inventory.
  - Its source-file reference is preserved.
  - The parser accepts it as a supported uniform scalar.
  - `Scalar value` resolves to a finite zero value instead of “No compatible values”.
  - statistics remain finite and report min/max/mean/std = 0.
- Uniform fields with no expanded mesh-cell count no longer pretend that the single stored uniform value means “one physical cell”; the UI explicitly reports that the mesh cell count was not expanded.

### Native field-routing finding
- Desktop now routes every native-backed OpenFOAM field through the native field parser first, regardless of file size; small fields are no longer excluded by the former >4 MB routing threshold.
- Browser/JS fallback remains available when native parsing itself fails.

### Binary field limitation corrected
- **Binary OpenFOAM field payloads remain explicitly unsupported by the field-analysis parser at this stage.**
- Binary `polyMesh` support does not imply binary field-value support.
- An earlier diagnostic incorrectly suggested that using the Desktop/native reader would solve `binary-format`; this was corrected.
- The actionable remedy now accurately tells the user to use/produce an ASCII field for that field/time (and reload it) until binary field-value decoding is implemented.
- Regression prevents reintroducing the false “native routing failed” instruction.

### Iso-surface / pointField diagnostic reconciliation
- Face-associated surface fields remain intentionally excluded from volumetric iso-surface reconstruction.
- Iso-surface now reports `iso-surface-association-incompatible` and directs the user to a volume/cell or point scalar field.
- Invalid and out-of-range iso values receive dedicated corrective guidance.
- pointField interior Slice/Iso reconstruction remains covered numerically.
- Two regressions still expected the old explanatory sentence after the product moved to structured diagnostics; both tests were updated to assert the stronger actionable contract instead of restoring obsolete wording.

### Coupling Audit / Vector Fields
- Coupling Audit now explains when no case/root residual evidence exists and when the loaded evidence is insufficient.
- Generic Vector Fields exposes missing X/Y/Z groups, invalid selection/alignment and post-creation refresh failures to the user instead of relying only on console warnings.

### Test-suite audit findings
- Current suite: **50 `desktop/tests/*.test.cjs` files**.
- A new suite-manifest regression enumerates every test file and every workflow test command and requires:
  - every test file to execute exactly once,
  - no test file to be omitted,
  - no duplicate workflow execution,
  - no workflow reference to a nonexistent test.
- This closes the previously observed duplicated Flow Analysis execution and guards against future hidden/unexecuted test files.
- Audit found that several older UI/wiring tests relied heavily on `source.includes(...)`. Those checks remain useful for structural contracts, but critical runtime behavior is now additionally covered by:
  - real B13 integration,
  - executed parser/analysis functions,
  - executed global diagnostic rendering,
  - native portable smoke,
  - installed-app smoke.
- Intermediate CI failures during this audit exposed stale test expectations rather than product regressions; the stale expectations were reconciled only after verifying the newer behavior.

### Final validation
- Tested product head: `4046e498627b5e6d14cc4160f056ee35d6fa7515`.
- GitHub Actions run **#385 — SUCCESS**.

## 2026-09-30 — FoamLens Desktop v1.4.3 Field View / performance development candidate

### User-observed defects and requirements
- Real v1.4.2 Field View testing exposed several usability and visualization issues:
  - thin rectangular/vertical/horizontal lines could cross the application UI;
  - 3D navigation lacked explicit orbit/pan/zoom and standard-view controls;
  - no interactive XYZ orientation gizmo was available;
  - the temperature legend could display visually indistinguishable values such as `1500 / 1500 / 1500` even when the underlying range was nonzero;
  - changing physical time could make visual controls feel blocked while a native field was being parsed;
  - temporal navigation needed cache/prefetch rather than repeated cold reads;
  - synchronized 3D analysis needed independent case/region/field/component selections and more than two simultaneous views;
  - the synchronized 3D layout needed video export.

### Cross-application canvas overlay root cause
- The base frontend applied `canvas{position:absolute;inset:0;width:100%;height:100%}` globally.
- Any analysis or 3D canvas that did not explicitly override that rule could therefore be positioned against the wrong containing block and visually cross unrelated UI, including the sidebar.
- The misleading `Physical time [s]` text seen in the overlay came from a 2D plot canvas, not from a Field View control.
- Structural fix: absolute full-area positioning is now scoped only to the primary 2D chart canvas:
  - `.chartwrap > canvas#canvas{position:absolute;inset:0;width:100%;height:100%}`
- Product commit: `e42ddcf112be2409a4ea75a6ab3a152a7be939b6`.

### Non-blocking native OpenFOAM field parsing
- Async file reads alone did not keep Field View responsive because CPU-heavy parsing resumed on the WinForms/WebView UI synchronization context.
- `HandleOpenFoamFieldAsync` now dispatches parsing and ASCII boundary decoding through a cancellable `Task.Run` worker and uses `ConfigureAwait(false)` inside that worker.
- Camera, opacity and other visual controls can therefore continue receiving UI events while a new field timestep is parsed.
- Regression explicitly requires the worker dispatch and cancellation token.
- Product commit: `5e9a50325372b1223ad6d754fbde269e53323061`.

### 3D navigation and orientation
- Field View now exposes explicit:
  - Orbit;
  - Pan;
  - Zoom;
  - Fit;
  - Reset;
  - Front / Back / Left / Right / Top / Bottom / Isometric views.
- An interactive XYZ gizmo is rendered inside the viewport, follows camera orientation and allows X/Y/Z click-to-view navigation.
- Middle/right drag remains a pan fallback; wheel zoom and double-click Fit are supported.
- Product commit: `be886d64c0bd4a2eb213f5651841660d2d160228`.
- Navigation regression: `feb046533ab9e21f16bacf5ffc4a34e60b67813b`.

### Intelligent scientific color ranges
- The former single `Lock color range` control was replaced by explicit modes:
  - Smart / current frame;
  - Global / all physical times;
  - Manual.
- Legend/statistics now expose Min, Max, mean and Δ.
- Numeric formatting increases precision automatically when a small field span sits on top of a large absolute value.
- Numerically uniform fields are represented explicitly as a uniform field rather than a misleading full gradient.
- Slice and iso-surface rendering use the same selected scientific range contract as the main surface.
- Product commits:
  - `b745377468b2fe97046dc8e248ae6924dc086036`
  - `b4a33c1f2b21bcc1c4f1083be37e2389bab9390f`
  - `bef20ee832df22311e8b8a87d974e8d3e4cb5292`.

### One bounded field cache + temporal prefetch
- Audit found that the base frontend already retained parsed fields in `pmFieldCache`, but that cache had no memory bound.
- A second Field View-only retention cache would have made a visible 512 MB budget misleading, so the architecture was consolidated instead.
- The shared OpenFOAM field cache is now bounded and LRU-evicted with:
  - tracked retained bytes;
  - configurable limit (256 MB / 512 MB / 1 GB / 2 GB from Field View);
  - recency touch on reads;
  - explicit trim/stat/clear helpers.
- Field View keeps only in-flight request deduplication and prefetches neighboring frames in the order next, next+1, previous.
- A transient implementation error that made the cache clear helper recursive was detected during the same audit and corrected before the final candidate.
- Product commits:
  - `ff367366ece31fff818c6568cdea56656d6e3e80`
  - correction `aa3ad831d3de6e64bf4aa3720b58514a28bae15f`
  - shared-cache Field View integration `684b18571b41693bc357df607bf54d260708058e`.

### Independent and multi-view 3D analysis
- Synchronized comparison no longer assumes “same field in a second case”.
- View 2 can independently select case, region, field and component; the same case may be selected to compare two different variables.
- Additional synchronized Views 3 and 4 can be added, for up to four simultaneous 3D viewports.
- Physical time and camera orientation remain synchronized; each viewport may represent a different quantity.
- Shared color ranges and strict signed 3D differences are only applied when the two relevant views represent the same field/component/association/dimensions.
- View 2 now uses the same generic field loader as Field View so cell-, point- and internal-face-associated fields are handled according to their real association instead of exposing options that silently required a volume field.
- Strict 3D difference remains deliberately limited to compatible cell-associated volume fields.
- Product commits:
  - independent View 2: `58efbe93db56bfbd571e74b4249f23a81c2d8145`
  - Views 3/4: `0d4eecc16d32d8625a6dd726a68bbc0fcdb04c76`
  - association-aware View 2: `18d476dec12dd41aea944c5640b1848ef358738e`.

### Multi-view animation / video export
- New module: `v14-animation-export.js`.
- Export controls include:
  - start/end physical time;
  - frame step;
  - 24/30/60 FPS;
  - 720p / 1080p / 1440p / 4K;
  - Auto (MP4 when supported), MP4 or WebM.
- Export preloads the requested physical-time frames and calculates an independent global color range for every visible 3D viewport before recording.
- Visible synchronized viewports are composited into one output video with view labels, physical time and range information.
- Video export uses the browser/WebView `MediaRecorder` + canvas `captureStream` capability and falls back to a supported encoded MIME type.
- Product commits:
  - animation export: `84376d18dbf4f00113dde7f8fc954c2a460e73ad`
  - fixed per-view video-range plumbing: `80d378d7b041b6833f1e19b59e2567ec0099fff8`
  - comparison descriptors/ranges: `3fe4410506c0e2dbf632e2fe6fae4d6af6ff4e1f`.
- Boundary: CI validates syntax/wiring and application packaging, but actual user-side codec availability still depends on the installed WebView2 runtime; the exporter reports when the requested encoding is unavailable.

### v1.4.3 development identity / CI
- Desktop project, assembly/file versions, runtime-bundle isolation, Field View identity, frontend export provenance and documentation were aligned to `v1.4.3`.
- Public release remains `v1.4.2`; no `v1.4.3` tag or GitHub Release was created.
- CI branch matching was generalized to `development/**` so current and future development branches receive the full Windows build without publishing.
- Intermediate CI findings were corrected rather than ignored:
  - run #387 exposed stale v1.4.2 version-test expectations;
  - runs #393/#394 exposed the old Field View cache-test expectation after cache consolidation.
- Those were stale regression expectations, not reasons to restore the obsolete implementation.

### Final development-candidate validation
- Tested product head: `f3afd81a31abf02544f334c1179acf5accf0573c`.
- GitHub Actions run **#397 — SUCCESS**.

- GitHub Release publication: **SKIPPED**. v1.4.3 remains a development candidate for real user-side visual/video testing.

### Candidate rule
- The validated product head above must remain identifiable even if documentation-only commits follow it.
- Any product-code change after `f3afd81a31abf02544f334c1179acf5accf0573c` requires a new full CI candidate before it is treated as the v1.4.3 test build.


## 2026-09-30 — v1.4.3 packaged-runtime smoke strengthened

### Why the runtime smoke was expanded
- The earlier v1.4.3 candidate (#397) proved product regressions, B13 integration, packaging and installer startup, but the Windows smoke only verified that Field View mounted.
- New runtime checks now execute inside the packaged WebView2 application rather than only inspecting source strings.

### Runtime 3D UI checks
- The packaged EXE now verifies at runtime that these controls/APIs actually mount:
  - Orbit / Pan / Zoom / Fit / Reset;
  - XYZ orientation gizmo;
  - Current / Global / Manual color-range modes;
  - comparison controls;
  - animation/video panel.
- The smoke programmatically presses `+ Add 3D view` twice and verifies synchronized Views 3 and 4 create their viewport, canvas and controls without duplicate DOM IDs.
- It verifies the original 2D chart canvas remains `position:absolute`, while the Field View canvas is not globally forced absolute. This directly guards the cross-application canvas-overlay defect.
- It invokes standard camera/pan/orbit UI controls inside the real WebView2 runtime.
- Run #399 confirmed this complete 3D runtime UI block passed in the packaged EXE.

### Real WebView2 video primitive smoke
- Initial run #399 failed after the 3D checks because the test harness returned an unresolved JavaScript Promise directly through `ExecuteScriptAsync`; WebView2 serialized the Promise object as `{}`.
- This was a smoke-harness defect, not evidence that video encoding failed.
- The harness was corrected to:
  - launch the async recorder inside WebView2;
  - store the resolved result in `window.__foamLensVideoSmokeResult`;
  - have C# poll that result with an explicit 8-second deadline;
  - require a non-empty encoded Blob.
- The smoke exercises the same browser primitives used by FoamLens export: `HTMLCanvasElement.captureStream` + `MediaRecorder`, with MP4/WebM capability negotiation.
- Product behavior was not weakened to make the test pass.

### New validated candidate
- Tested head: `c56e5e951f512b696f5a73cd8920be742bca33f4`.
- GitHub Actions run **#401 — SUCCESS**.
- Real QuickCup/B13 regression job: **SUCCESS**.

- Packaged portable EXE runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**, including:
  - v1.4.3 3D controls/APIs;
  - View 3 + View 4 runtime creation;
  - canvas layout isolation;
  - scientific color-range modes;
  - actual WebView2 canvas-video encoding producing a non-empty Blob.
- Installer build: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-app runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.3`.
- Artifact id: `11091436790`.
- Artifact size: 135,289,646 bytes.
- Artifact digest: `sha256:dc64e7ae95b975f651f5efac2df062b56d16cfd36a4d00696f4cfe7300d95582`.
- GitHub Release publication remains **SKIPPED**; v1.4.2 is still the public stable release.

### Important limitation still being closed
- B13 is currently validated through the dedicated real OpenFOAM integration job, while the packaged Windows smoke uses mounted UI plus a synthetic recording canvas.
- The next CI hardening target is loading the private B13 fixture into the packaged WebView2 application during smoke, if this can be done through a smoke-only bridge without introducing fixture-specific behavior into the product UI or scientific logic.


## 2026-09-30 — B13 rendered inside packaged Windows FoamLens

### Why a second real-case path was needed
- The existing QuickCup integration job already validated the real B13 files on Linux, but it did not prove that the packaged Windows application could traverse the same Smart Import -> case metadata -> Field View -> native field/mesh bridge -> WebGL path.
- A smoke-only, fixture-agnostic runtime helper was therefore injected only when the executable starts with `--smoke-test`.
- Normal FoamLens runs do not expose this helper and contain no B13-specific scientific logic.

### Smoke-only packaged real-case path
- The runtime helper receives native file references for any OpenFOAM case and uses the real FoamLens functions:
  - `runProjectScan(files)`;
  - Smart Import candidate creation;
  - `importSelectedAsCases()`;
  - Data / Field View navigation;
  - normal region/field selectors;
  - `fvLoadSelection()`;
  - normal native mesh/field parsing and WebGL rendering.
- C# then requires the rendered frame to report:
  - a 3D-ready case;
  - nonzero mesh cells;
  - nonzero field values;
  - a finite field range;
  - nonzero rendered surface vertices;
  - an active WebGL context;
  - `gl.getError() == 0`;
  - the requested region/field when the smoke environment specifies them.
- CI requests `region=metal` and `field=T`; those names exist only in workflow fixture configuration, not in FoamLens product selection logic.
- Product/runtime-helper commit: `b60948f8bdae626bb77cca38c2e6c9d11189c880`.

### Windows path incompatibility discovered
- A direct Windows checkout of QuickCup failed before FoamLens could start because OpenFOAM output contains filenames legal on Linux but impossible on NTFS, notably `phaseChangeSource:alpha1`.
- This is not confined to an unrelated case: B13 itself contains `phaseChangeSource:alpha1` at many physical times.
- QuickCup/thesis files were not renamed or modified.

### Windows-safe real fixture staging
- The Linux real-fixture job now creates a temporary Windows-safe B13 runtime copy.
- It omits only path components that Windows cannot represent (invalid NTFS characters, trailing dot/space, reserved device names) and rejects case-insensitive path collisions.
- Required inputs are asserted after staging, including:
  - `constant/metal/polyMesh/points`;
  - `constant/metal/polyMesh/faces`;
  - `constant/metal/polyMesh/owner`;
  - `0/metal/T`.
- Run #407 staging result:
  - **4,584 files copied byte-for-byte**;
  - **101 NTFS-impossible paths omitted**;
  - omitted examples are the `phaseChangeSource:alpha1` field at successive physical times.
- The staged B13 artifact is uploaded from Linux and downloaded by Windows; Windows no longer git-checks out the private QuickCup repository.
- CI staging commit: `487395afecceeea6962afcd5a1cf329d242f1b0b`.
- Final extracted-path correction for portable and installed smoke: `a407131baa9a8b837a55fccb0c1fec8bfb434f52`.

### Fully validated v1.4.3 candidate
- Tested product/CI head: `a407131baa9a8b837a55fccb0c1fec8bfb434f52`.
- GitHub Actions run **#407 — SUCCESS**.

- Windows-safe B13 fixture preparation/upload/download: **SUCCESS**.
- Full Windows scientific/UI regression suite: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable EXE build: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable packaged-runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**, including:

- Artifact size: 135,252,937 bytes.
- Artifact digest: `sha256:92463f2d32b49db87d36a6f1d86e1cf71dadf118db70646edcbb6b3ceafa72f8`.
- Temporary staged fixture artifact: `QuickCup-B13-Windows-runtime`, artifact id `11091897433`, one-day retention.
- GitHub Release publication remains **SKIPPED**. Public stable remains v1.4.2.

### Candidate rule
- `a407131baa9a8b837a55fccb0c1fec8bfb434f52` is now the strongest validated v1.4.3 product candidate.
- Any product-code or workflow behavior change after that head requires a new full validation run before replacing it as the candidate.


## 2026-09-30 — v1.4.3 late-time thermal visualization closed on real B13 packaged runtime

### Why this check was added
- User testing of v1.4.2 showed a Field View legend of `1500 / 1500 / 1500` even around `t = 9.8 s`, although the real simulation was known to have thermal evolution.
- Direct inspection of the B13 OpenFOAM fixture established:
  - `t = 0 s`: `internalField uniform 1500`;
  - `t = 9.8 s`: 6400 cell values, min `1417.57 K`, max `1481.90 K`, span `64.33 K`;
  - `t = 9.9 s`: min `1417.56 K`, max `1481.56 K`, span `64.00 K`.
- Therefore a `1500 / 1500 / 1500` legend is correct only for the initial uniform frame and incorrect for the late-time B13 field.

### Smoke contract strengthened
- The smoke-only OpenFOAM import helper can now request a specific physical time.
- The packaged runtime reports:
  - selected physical time;
  - field min/max;
  - field span;
  - rendered legend text;
  - cells/points/value count;
  - WebGL status/error;
  - active 3D plot title/info.
- CI now requests:
  - region: `metal`;
  - field: `T`;
  - physical time: `9.8 s`;
  - minimum acceptable field span: `1 K`.
- Portable and installed application smokes fail if the late B13 frame collapses back to an effectively uniform field.

### Final validation
- Tested head: `dd3348ce268db23ad330573b34aa62e06a035d40`.
- GitHub Actions run **#416 — SUCCESS**.
- Real QuickCup/B13 regression: **SUCCESS**.

- Portable packaged runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-application runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- WebView2 video primitive smoke:

- Portable B13 runtime evidence at `t = 9.8 s`:
  - case: `B13_prghPressure_airGapOF14`;
  - region: `metal`;
  - field: `T`;
  - association/storage: cell / volume;
  - cells: `6400`;
  - points: `13122`;
  - values: `6400`;
  - min: `1417.57 K`;
  - max: `1481.90 K`;
  - span: `64.33 K`;
  - WebGL error: `0`;
  - surface vertices: `78720`;
  - legend: `T [K] · 1,418 · 1,450 · 1,482 · current · Δ 64`;
  - active header: `3D OpenFOAM Field View · Mesh + transient fields`.
- Installed runtime returned the same numerical and rendering evidence.
- Visual screenshots confirm a visible late-time thermal gradient and no cross-application canvas overlay lines.

## 2026-09-30 — FoamLens Desktop v1.4.4 Field Workspace candidate

### Scope closed in this candidate
- Field View is promoted from the Data sub-tabs to a first-class top-level application mode alongside Overview, Data, Analysis, Review and Live.
- The legacy Data `Field View` tab remains hidden in the new workflow; existing routes to `field3d` redirect into the top-level Field workspace.
- Field Workspace supports simultaneous 3D + 2D diagnostics instead of forcing the user to choose one or the other.
- Companion plot options include Spatial Profile, Time Series, Solver Logs or None.
- Spatial Profile can follow the 3D physical time while the 3D renderer remains mounted.
- `+ Add 3D View` is visible in the Field Workspace header.
- Up to four synchronized 3D viewports remain supported.
- Each 3D viewport retains independent case / region / field / component selectors.
- Visible synchronized 3D views remain eligible for the same animation/video export.

### Real 3D Case selector defect
- User testing showed the Case selector could visually change while the renderer stayed bound to the previous case.
- Root cause: the Case `onchange` path called `fvRefreshSelectors(false)`, which discarded the explicit user selection and reselected the active context case.
- The Case selector now routes through `fvHandleCaseChange()`.
- Case switching now invalidates stale frame, prefetch, global-range, mesh, field, vector, streamline, slice and Probe state before rebuilding the selected case.
- The handler preserves the explicitly selected case and verifies that both `fvState.caseId` and `fvCase().id` remain bound to it after loading.

### End-to-end multi-case selector smoke
- The QuickCup fixture branch contains one complete transient 3D runtime fixture (B13); the sibling V12/V13 directories do not contain the full generated 3D payload.
- CI therefore creates distinct smoke case identities backed by the same complete B13 payload. This tests selector/state mechanics without pretending that the incomplete sibling fixtures are complete CFD results.
- Portable and installed runtime smoke both import four 3D-ready case identities.
- The smoke changes the real `#fvCase` select value and dispatches a real bubbling `change` event.
- It waits for `fvState.caseId` and `fvCase().name` to change before continuing.
- Validated transition: `SmokeCase_A -> B13_prghPressure_airGapOF14`.
- Runtime evidence confirms:
  - `caseCount = 4`;
  - `readyCaseCount = 4`;
  - `caseSwitchChanged = true`;
  - switched case ID differs from initial case ID;
  - renderer case ID equals switched case ID;
  - final rendered case is `B13_prghPressure_airGapOF14`.

### Field Workspace runtime evidence
- Portable and installed smoke both confirm:
  - top-level `Field View` navigation is visible;
  - `Field Workspace` is the active application mode;
  - the 3D panel is mounted under `fw3DHost`;
  - Spatial Profile is mounted simultaneously under `fw2DHost`;
  - companion mode is `profile`;
  - `+ Add 3D View` is visible;
  - View 3 and View 4 can mount without duplicate DOM IDs;
  - the main 3D canvas is not affected by the old global absolute-canvas defect.
- Final smoke screenshot visually confirms the split workspace with 3D and Spatial Profile shown at the same time.

### Probe visibility
- Probe now exposes explicit ON/OFF state.
- Disabling Probe clears the WebGL marker rather than only changing the control label/cursor.
- A high-contrast overlay marker/reticle follows the picked point.
- Probe marker size is configurable: S / M / L.
- Runtime rendering updates the overlay position after camera redraws.

### Vector and streamline resolution
- Vectors and Streamlines now have independent collapsible control blocks beneath their ON/OFF toggles.
- Vector resolution options:
  - Adaptive;
  - 150;
  - 300;
  - 600;
  - 1200;
  - 2400 glyphs.
- Glyph size is independently adjustable.
- Vector sampling no longer relies only on a raw every-N-cells stride; it uses the spatial hash to distribute glyph samples across the domain and reports the actual glyph count.
- Synchronized View 2 uses the same vector-resolution and glyph-size controls instead of a hard-coded 280 glyphs.
- Streamline seed density can be raised up to 400 seeds and is independent from vector glyph density.
- Streamline controls remain separated from vector controls.

### Navigation cleanup
- Field View is now part of the base navigation model (`workspace/data/field/analysis/review/live`).
- The Workspace fallback only creates a Field navigation button if the base button is absent.
- Fallback click wiring is added only when that fallback button was actually created, preventing duplicate Field navigation listeners.

### Scientific regression retained
- B13 `metal/T` at `t = 9.8 s` remains the late-time thermal runtime reference.
- Portable and installed smoke both report:
  - 6400 cell values;
  - 13122 mesh points;
  - min `1417.57 K`;
  - max `1481.90 K`;
  - span `64.33 K`;
  - legend `1,418 / 1,450 / 1,482 · current · Δ 64`;
  - WebGL error `0`.
- The video primitive smoke again produced a non-empty MP4/H.264-compatible blob in WebView2.

### Final v1.4.4 candidate validation

- GitHub Release publication remains **not performed** for v1.4.4 in this development branch.

### Candidate rule
- Any product-code change after `71ce31ed83b50b0c76896b8a5ef7abe7b445f5b0` requires a new full candidate run before promotion.


## 2026-09-30 — FoamLens Desktop v1.4.5 multi-view legend / Probe patch line

### Why v1.4.5 exists
- Public v1.4.4 was already tagged and published from commit `93b04a4c5cac5e591519eb0f49e1939ab85a437c`.
- Subsequent real-user testing of that release exposed two visible multi-view defects:
  - an added 3D viewport could render its field but show no local color scale/legend;
  - Probe could be enabled while the added viewport gave insufficient visual feedback, making it look as if Probe did nothing.
- The v1.4.4 tag/assets are not moved or replaced. These post-release fixes are promoted as v1.4.5.

### Per-viewport scientific legend
- View 2 and dynamically added Views 3/4 now own an independent `fcLegend` element inside their viewport.
- Legend rendering uses the field/component actually selected for that viewport, its dimensions/unit and its active display range.
- Non-uniform fields show min / midpoint / max plus Δ.
- Numerically uniform fields are explicitly labelled uniform instead of drawing a misleading gradient.
- Extra-view upload refreshes the local legend on every field/frame change.
- Comparison View 2 refreshes its legend on synchronized frame loads and visual-range changes.
- The legend is anchored to the viewport itself, so different variables/cases may display different scientifically meaningful scales simultaneously.

### Probe in synchronized / added 3D views
- Probe state is shared with the Field View Probe ON/OFF control, but every comparison viewport now installs its own click picking path.
- View 2 and Views 3/4 perform picking against their own mesh, association and field values rather than reusing the primary view's data.
- Each additional viewport owns a high-contrast `fcProbeMarker` overlay.
- Clicking geometry while Probe is ON stores a viewport-specific probe result, redraws its marker and updates the per-view statistics grid.
- Changing case / region / field / component clears the stale probe for that viewport.
- Probe OFF prevents comparison-view picking and keeps probe markers from being presented as active selections.

### Multi-view continuity retained from v1.4.4 development work
- Field View remains a first-class top-level application mode.
- 3D + Spatial Profile can remain mounted simultaneously.
- `+ Add 3D View` remains visible in Field Workspace.
- Up to four synchronized 3D viewports are supported with independent case / region / field / component.
- Visible synchronized views remain included in the same video export.
- Vector resolution / glyph size and streamline seed density remain independently adjustable.
- Safe 3D case switching continues to invalidate stale case work before binding the renderer to the newly selected case.

### Release discipline
- v1.4.4 remains the immutable historical release containing the behavior seen in the user's screenshot.
- v1.4.5 is the patch release line for the post-v1.4.4 multi-view legend / Probe fixes.
- Public release before promotion: v1.4.4.
- Development identity: v1.4.5 / frontend v51.


### Final v1.4.5 candidate validation
- Tested product head: `6bd6ed194ea5da284a9b14f39a5a67ce112415ee`.
- GitHub Actions run **#485 — SUCCESS**.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows-safe multi-case runtime fixture preparation/upload/download: **SUCCESS**.
- Full Windows scientific/UI regression suite: **SUCCESS**.
- Field View regression: **SUCCESS**.
- 3D Probe regression: **SUCCESS**.
- 3D comparison / multi-view regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable EXE build: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable packaged-runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-application smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- Development-branch Release publication: **SKIPPED**, as expected.

### Packaged-runtime evidence for the reported v1.4.4 defects
- The packaged WebView2 smoke enables synchronized View 2 through the public UI/runtime API.
- It selects a distinct comparison case and verifies that the selection persists in the actual rendered View 2 descriptor.
- It optionally switches View 2 to a field distinct from the primary viewport.
- It requires the secondary viewport's `#fcLegend` to:
  - be present;
  - not carry the hidden class;
  - have nonzero rendered width/height;
  - contain non-empty scientific legend text.
- It enables the shared Probe control, clicks multiple real positions in the View 2 canvas and requires:
  - a View 2 probe descriptor;
  - a finite selected value;
  - a visible `#fcProbeMarker` with nonzero dimensions;
  - updated selected-value statistics.
- A failure in either the local View 2 legend or the secondary Probe marker makes the packaged smoke fail.

## 2026-10-02 — FoamLens post-v1.4.5 pending roadmap

### Roadmap policy
- This section intentionally records **pending / proposed work**, not completed product behavior.
- An item remains pending until product code, regressions and packaged-runtime evidence exist.
- Completed items should be moved into a dated validation section rather than silently removed from this roadmap.
- Current public release at the time this roadmap was written: **v1.4.5**.

### P0 — Scientific visualization / trust
- **Streamline seeding and integration controls**
  - add explicit seed modes: Plane / Line / Box-Volume / Patch;
  - expose seed density independently from vector glyph density;
  - add Forward / Backward / Both integration direction;
  - expose max integration length, max steps and integration step controls;
  - report actual streamline count and integration-point count;
  - support coloring streamlines by velocity magnitude or another compatible scalar field;
  - validate representative streamline paths against ParaView/VTK before calling the feature thesis-grade.
- **Vector glyph analysis controls**
  - keep Adaptive / fixed glyph-count resolution and glyph-size controls;
  - add normalized-length vs magnitude-proportional arrow modes;
  - allow region/ROI-based glyph sampling;
  - report requested vs actually rendered glyph count;
  - validate spatial sampling against the underlying vector field rather than only visual density.
- **Per-viewport visual independence**
  - allow every 3D viewport to own its own colormap, color-range mode, opacity, vector/streamline visibility, Slice/Iso settings and Probe state when desired;
  - add an explicit Sync visual settings toggle rather than implicitly sharing all visualization controls;
  - retain independent scientific legends for every viewport.
- **Scientific provenance in the viewport**
  - make field association, dimensions/units, physical time, region, case and parser/source provenance visible without opening the catalog;
  - expose when a frame is Exact / Nearest / Interpolated in multi-case synchronized views.

### P0 — Multi-view / case comparison
- **Camera synchronization groups**
  - add Link cameras ON/OFF;
  - allow one viewport to be rotated independently without breaking the others;
  - provide Re-sync camera and Fit all actions.
- **Time synchronization modes per comparison**
  - Exact / Nearest / Interpolated physical-time synchronization;
  - explicit per-view Δt badges when times are not exact;
  - prevent silent index-based equivalence.
- **Generalized 3D difference**
  - choose any two compatible visible views as A and B;
  - support signed difference, absolute difference and percent difference where scientifically valid;
  - keep strict association / dimensions / mesh-compatibility checks.
- **Multi-case matrix workflow**
  - quicker Case A / B / C / D assignment;
  - copy visual settings from one viewport to another;
  - swap views without rebuilding the workspace.

### P1 — 3D + 2D linked analysis
- **Interactive profile definition from the 3D view**
  - draw a line in 3D and immediately generate a Spatial Profile along it;
  - support axis-aligned and arbitrary lines;
  - show the sampled line/plane visibly inside the 3D viewport.
- **Probe-to-profile linking**
  - selecting a 3D Probe should optionally move a cursor/marker on the Spatial Profile;
  - selecting a point on a Spatial Profile should optionally highlight the corresponding 3D location.
- **Synchronized companion plots**
  - keep Spatial Profile / Time Series / Solver Logs simultaneously available beside 3D;
  - make the physical-time link explicit and reversible;
  - allow more than one 2D companion panel when screen space permits.
- **Cross-case profile comparison**
  - overlay profiles from multiple selected 3D cases/fields at the same physical time;
  - display difference / relative difference without extrapolating beyond common support.

### P1 — Animation / video
- **Camera-path / keyframe animation**
  - save camera keyframes and interpolate orbit / pan / zoom through the exported animation.
- **Scientific video overlays**
  - configurable case / field / region / time / legend / Δt labels;
  - optional watermark/provenance and thesis-safe title block.
- **Multi-view video layouts**
  - 1-up / 2-up / 2×2 templates;
  - optional 3D + Spatial Profile composition in the same video;
  - preserve an independent fixed global color range for each viewport across the full recording.
- **Export quality controls**
  - bitrate/quality presets;
  - frame-step and playback-speed controls;
  - explicit codec/fallback reporting for MP4/WebM.

### P1 — Performance / responsiveness
- **Progressive frame rendering**
  - update the visible viewport as soon as its required field is ready instead of waiting for hidden or secondary views.
- **Viewport-aware loading**
  - prioritize active/visible viewports;
  - lazy-load hidden secondary views;
  - cancel stale case/time/field requests aggressively.
- **GPU/resource reuse**
  - reuse mesh and WebGL buffers when only field values change;
  - avoid rebuilding equivalent geometry across synchronized views.
- **Cache telemetry**
  - show hit/miss/prefetch counts in addition to retained MB;
  - expose a clear-cache action;
  - distinguish mesh cache from field cache.
- **Playback prefetch policy**
  - adaptive prefetch depth based on current playback speed and measured parse time.

### P1 — Export / thesis workflow
- **Multi-panel thesis figure export**
  - export 3D + Spatial Profile / comparison views as one high-resolution figure;
  - consistent margins, labels, legends and physical-time caption.
- **Per-view export**
  - export an individual viewport without hiding the others first.
- **Reusable figure presets**
  - save camera, field, range, legend and layout presets for repeatable thesis figures.

### P2 — Workspace / usability
- **Persistent Field Workspace layouts**
  - save and restore viewport count, case/field assignments, companion plots, splitter positions and synchronization settings.
- **Per-view rename / labels**
  - user labels such as Baseline / Pressure BC / Fixed Value for presentations and exports.
- **Visual comparison status bar**
  - compact always-visible summary of linked camera, linked time, active Probe, vector glyph count and streamline count.
- **Keyboard/mouse discoverability**
  - viewport help overlay for orbit / pan / zoom / Probe shortcuts.
- **Resizable multi-view panels**
  - drag splitters between 3D viewports and companion plots instead of fixed equal columns.

### Recommended next implementation order
1. Streamline seeding/integration controls + ParaView validation.
2. Per-viewport visual settings and camera-link toggle.
3. Interactive 3D-defined Spatial Profile.
4. Generalized A/B 3D difference and explicit time-sync modes.
5. Multi-panel thesis/video export.
6. Performance pass with viewport-aware loading and GPU-buffer reuse.

### Already closed before this roadmap
- top-level Field Workspace;
- simultaneous 3D + Spatial Profile workflow;
- visible Add 3D View and up to four synchronized views;
- safe 3D case switching;
- independent added-view legends;
- Probe marker/picking in added 3D views;
- adjustable vector glyph resolution / size;
- adjustable streamline seed density;
- synchronized multi-view video export;
- late-time B13 thermal-range validation;
- packaged portable + installed runtime evidence for v1.4.5.

## 2026-10-03 — v1.4.6 visible-version validation repaired and completed

- Development branch: `development/v1.4.6-visible-version`.
- Product change already present on the branch: persistent visible FoamLens Desktop v1.4.6 identity across the desktop UI/runtime.
- Previous Windows builds on 2026-10-02 failed after the real QuickCup regression had already passed because `desktop/tests/native-performance.test.cjs` still expected the historical runtime-smoke text `FoamLens v1.4.5 3D runtime UI smoke passed` while `Program.cs` correctly emitted the v1.4.6 identity.
- Fix commit: `a80ffd51d7a13c3dfc12e28df863aea6df917d09` — `test: align native runtime smoke with v1.4.6`.
- The fix changed only the stale regression expectation/name/error text; production runtime behavior was not altered.
- GitHub Actions run **#494** (`37104141077`) completed **SUCCESS**.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Native background progress/cancellation regression: **SUCCESS**; this was the step that had blocked the previous v1.4.6 builds.
- 3D Field View, point-field reconstruction, decomposed meshes, dynamic mesh, iso-surfaces, 3D Probe, explicit surface fields, strict 3D difference, Smart Import, dual Time-Series Focus, convergence, momentum, energy, experimental validation, contextual UI, diagnostics and bilingual/overflow regressions: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows executable build: **SUCCESS**.
- Packaged portable runtime smoke with real OpenFOAM fixture: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows installer build: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-application runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows build artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- Release publication: **SKIPPED**, expected for a development-branch push.
- Artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.4.6`, id `11267431426`, size `135,196,674 bytes`, digest `sha256:63089cb91f640ca78ea7cb7c19217947bb2500251d1c97b547c84a8ed652d015`.
- Multi-case runtime fixture artifact: `QuickCup-MultiCase-Windows-runtime`, id `11267780761`, size `326,073,834 bytes`, digest `sha256:32d37d99429fa308cdfc410d08866d6419fbe5f6ccbe152a84039d6fabffdaa7`.
- Public release remains **v1.4.5**; v1.4.6 is validated and ready for promotion when explicitly requested.


## 2026-10-03 — Compact Word-style ribbon navigation validated

- Development branch: \`development/v1.4.7-ribbon-navigation\`.
- Validated product head: \`36bc401b0a130776cc8629ae5e479406992b5893\`.
- Base product identity remains FoamLens Desktop v1.4.6 / frontend v51 on this development branch; no release-version promotion was performed.

### UI organization
- Added \`desktop/src/FoamLensDesktop/frontend/v15-ribbon-ui.js\`.
- Replaced the visible legacy top mode bar/tool cluster with a compact Word-style ribbon only after the ribbon mounts successfully.
- Ribbon tabs:
  - Home;
  - Data;
  - 3D / Field;
  - Plots;
  - Analysis;
  - Compare;
  - Export;
  - View.
- Major actions are icon-first with small text labels beneath the icons rather than text-heavy buttons.
- The implementation exposes 54 ribbon actions while preserving the existing scientific/runtime handlers instead of duplicating their logic.
- Project / Case / Region context and workspace save/open controls remain visible in the ribbon context strip.
- Ribbon tabs navigate directly to their corresponding workspace where appropriate.
- Legacy \`modeNavBar\` and the old top tool row are hidden only after successful ribbon installation.

### Existing controls reused rather than replaced
- Data import: Add files / Add folder.
- Data views: Time Series / Spatial Profiles / Solver Logs / Catalog.
- Field Workspace: Add 3D View / Configure views / Split / 3D focus / Plot focus.
- Scientific inspection: Probe / Slice / Vectors / Streamlines.
- Camera: Fit / Reset.
- Analysis: General / Coupling / Front tracking / Difference / Field Mapping / Phase Change-Momentum.
- 3D comparison: Compare 3D / Add view / Configure / Difference.
- Export: PNG / SVG / CSV / Thesis Figure / Video.
- View: sidebar / fit / theme / language.

### Cases menu integration
- The existing Case visibility panel is re-homed under the ribbon instead of being left inside the now-hidden legacy toolbar.
- Ribbon action click propagation is contained so the legacy document-level outside-click handler does not immediately close the Case menu.
- Packaged runtime smoke verified:
  - \`casePanelOpen = true\`;
  - \`casePanelParent = flRibbon\`.

### Regression / smoke issues found during validation
- Run #499 exposed a stale source-audit assumption: the test searched for fully materialized ribbon tab IDs even though the module generates them dynamically. The test was corrected to audit the stable tab definitions / ID builders.
- Run #501 reached packaged runtime and proved the ribbon runtime smoke itself passed, but a historical Field View smoke still required the legacy \`modeField\` navigation button to be visible.
- Runs #504/#505 confirmed:
  - ribbon runtime smoke passed;
  - Cases menu mounted/opened correctly;
  - \`fieldRibbonVisible = true\`;
  - the remaining failure was only the historical legacy-navigation assertion.
- The final smoke now validates the visible ribbon Field tab and checks the hidden state on the legacy navigation container (\`modeNavBar\`) instead of querying the hidden child button's own computed \`display\`.

### Automated coverage
- Added \`desktop/tests/ribbon-ui.test.cjs\`.
- Added the ribbon audit to \`.github/workflows/build-foamlens-desktop.yml\`.
- Source audit result: 8 ribbon tabs / 54 actions, with all required existing-control targets present.
- WebView2 startup smoke verifies:
  - ribbon mounted;
  - all expected tabs/actions exist;
  - icon / small-label hierarchy exists;
  - Field tab activates the Field workspace;
  - legacy top navigation/tool row is hidden;
  - Project / Case / Region context is preserved;
  - Cases menu is re-homed and opens from the ribbon.

### Final validation
- GitHub Actions run **#506** (\`37106117480\`): **SUCCESS**.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Full scientific/UI regression suite: **SUCCESS**.
- 3D Field View, pointField reconstruction, decomposed meshes, dynamic mesh, iso-surfaces, Probe, explicit surface fields and strict 3D difference: **SUCCESS**.
- Ribbon source audit: **SUCCESS**.
- Bilingual / overflow audits: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows executable build: **SUCCESS**.
- Packaged portable runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- The packaged smoke reports the new \`3D / Field\` ribbon navigation visible while Field Workspace, B13 multi-case switching, local legends and synchronized View 2 Probe remain functional.
- Portable checksum creation: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-application runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- GitHub Release publication: **SKIPPED**, expected for a development branch.

## 2026-10-03 — v1.4.8 scientific workspace: advanced streamlines, independent views and 3D-defined profiles

- Development branch: `development/v1.4.8-scientific-workspace`.
- Validated product head: `aee2581127c3771b93b4c7fda3177009dd25c652`.
- Base executable/version identity remains FoamLens Desktop v1.4.6 / frontend v51 on this development branch; no release-version promotion was performed.
- This line implements the next three prioritized scientific-workspace improvements after the ribbon validation.

### 1. Advanced streamline controls

#### Density bug resolved
- The UI had advertised up to 400 streamline seeds, but `fvSeedPlane()` internally clamped the request to 64.
- The seed-count contract is now 1–400 and the requested Plane/Line/Box count is honored exactly.
- Regression evidence:
  - Plane request 100 -> 100 seeds;
  - Plane request 400 -> 400 seeds;
  - Line request 73 -> 73 seeds;
  - Box request 125 -> 125 seeds.
- The packaged real-case smoke also reports `streamlineSeed400 = 400`.

#### New seeding modes
- Plane.
- Line.
- Box / Volume.
- Boundary patch.
- Boundary-patch mode seeds from actual OpenFOAM boundary faces, ignores processor patches and nudges the seed toward the owner-cell center to avoid immediate integration outside the domain.

#### Integration controls
- Forward / Backward / Both direction.
- Integration step expressed as a percentage of domain diagonal.
- Maximum integration steps per direction.
- Maximum physical path length expressed as a percentage of domain diagonal.
- Streamline metadata now reports actual seed count, generated streamline count and integration-point count.

#### Integration regression
- Uniform-field regression verifies forward and backward propagation.
- Maximum path length is enforced from accumulated geometric distance.
- Both-direction integration produces the combined two-sided path rather than silently behaving as a forward-only trace.
- Synchronized View 2 now uses the same advanced streamline settings rather than the previous Plane-only defaults.

### 2. Independent multi-view cameras and visual settings

#### Camera control
- Added `Link cameras` ON/OFF.
- Added `Re-sync`.
- Added `Fit all`.
- When cameras are linked, View 2 / additional views continue to derive camera orientation and relative distance from the primary view.
- When cameras are unlinked, each comparison viewport owns its own camera state and supports independent orbit, pan, wheel zoom and fit.

#### Visual synchronization
- Added `Sync visual settings` ON/OFF.
- With sync enabled, comparison views retain the shared visual behavior.
- With sync disabled, View 2 can independently control:
  - colormap;
  - opacity;
  - surface visibility;
  - mesh edges;
  - Slice;
  - Iso;
  - Vectors;
  - Streamlines.
- Views 3/4 can independently control:
  - colormap;
  - opacity;
  - surface visibility;
  - mesh edges;
  - Slice;
  - Iso.
- Independent visual mode also prevents the comparison view from forcing a shared display range onto the primary viewport.

#### Runtime evidence
- The packaged WebView2 smoke disables camera linking, zooms View 2 and verifies:
  - `independentCameraChanged = true`;
  - `primaryCameraUnaffected = true`.
- The same smoke disables visual synchronization, applies View 2 opacity independently and verifies:
  - `independentVisualApplied = true`;
  - `linkedCameras = false`;
  - `syncedVisuals = false`.
- Existing View 2 local legend and Probe-marker runtime checks continue to pass.

### 3. Spatial Profile defined directly from the 3D geometry

#### Interactive workflow
- Added `Draw profile` to Field Workspace and the 3D/Field ribbon.
- The user selects point A and point B directly on rendered 3D geometry.
- Picking reuses the same rendered-geometry ray-casting path as the existing Probe tool rather than estimating coordinates from screen position.
- A high-contrast A→B overlay is rendered on the 3D viewport and follows camera redraws.
- Line sampling is configurable from 20 to 500 samples; default is 160.
- Added `Clear line`.

#### Native Spatial Profile integration
- The A→B result is inserted into FoamLens as a normal Spatial Profile series rather than a separate ad-hoc plot.
- Generated series metadata includes:
  - `datasetType = profile`;
  - `profileAxis = s`;
  - `profileLine = 3D A→B`;
  - `profileCoordUnit = m`;
  - `derivedKind = field3d_line_profile`;
  - saved point A / point B / sample count.
- Sampling reuses `fwSampleFieldAtPoint()` and the currently loaded 3D field.
- The same derived profile is refreshed when the active 3D frame changes.

#### Real QuickCup runtime evidence
- B13 real-case smoke at the established late-time reference generated:
  - 160 requested profile samples;
  - 160 finite samples;
  - `profile3DDerivedKind = field3d_line_profile`;
  - `profile3DError = ""`;
  - A→B length = `0.05586143571373727 m`.
- The companion remains the normal Spatial Profile workflow.

### Ribbon integration
- 3D / Field ribbon now exposes:
  - Profile line;
  - Link cameras;
  - Re-sync;
  - Visual sync;
  - Fit all.
- Active state is reflected for Profile line, Link cameras and Visual sync.

### Regression history
- Run #507 validated the advanced-streamline implementation independently: **SUCCESS**.
- Runs #508–#513 exposed stale exact-source assertions in the historical comparison test after camera/legend signatures changed; real QuickCup regression continued to pass. Those tests were updated to validate linked-or-independent camera behavior and palette-aware per-viewport legends.
- Run #514 then completed the full scientific/UI suite, portable smoke, installer smoke and artifact upload successfully.
- Run #518 intentionally strengthened the packaged smoke for independent camera/visual behavior and initially failed because the smoke attempted to access encapsulated `fvState` from global WebView2 scope. Product behavior was not the failing condition.
- The comparison runtime API now exposes primary and comparison view state through `getViewStates()`, and the smoke validates through that public API instead of breaking module encapsulation.

### Final validation
- GitHub Actions run **#520** (`37108477817`): **SUCCESS**.
- Tested product head: `aee2581127c3771b93b4c7fda3177009dd25c652`.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Full scientific/UI regression suite: **SUCCESS**.
- 3D Difference regression after independent-view changes: **SUCCESS**.
- Field View / pointField / decomposed mesh / dynamic mesh / iso-surface / Probe / surface-field regressions: **SUCCESS**.
- Advanced streamline regression: **SUCCESS**.
- A→B Spatial Profile regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Ribbon / bilingual / overflow regressions: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows build: **SUCCESS**.
- Packaged portable runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable checksum: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-application runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- GitHub Release publication: **SKIPPED**, expected for a development branch.

### Run #520 packaged evidence

  - 6400 cells;
  - 13122 points;

### Scientific validation boundary
- The streamline implementation is covered by analytical/unit regressions, full application regressions and real QuickCup packaged-runtime smoke.
- Direct path-by-path comparison of representative FoamLens streamlines against ParaView/VTK has **not yet been performed**.
- Therefore this work should not yet be described as ParaView-validated or thesis-grade streamline equivalence until that cross-tool validation is completed.

### Promotion state
- No merge to `main`.
- No public release created.
- Public release remains **v1.4.5**.
- The `development/v1.4.8-scientific-workspace` product head is validated and ready for user review / later promotion.

## 2026-10-03 — v1.4.9 scientific compare, thesis export and progressive performance validated

- Development branch: \`development/v1.4.9-compare-export-performance\`.
- Validated product head: \`dd20752a957bf196728dce0922921b37f48655e8\`.
- Base executable/version identity remains FoamLens Desktop v1.4.6 / frontend v51 on this development branch; no public version bump or release promotion was performed.
- This line implements the next three prioritized blocks after the v1.4.8 scientific workspace: advanced 3D comparison, thesis/paper multi-panel export, and progressive performance/cache behavior.

### 1. Scientific 3D comparison

#### Physical-time synchronization
- View 2 / comparison views now support:
  - \`Exact\`;
  - \`Nearest\`;
  - \`Interpolated\`.
- Added \`fcTimeBracket()\`, \`fcResolveTime()\`, \`fcInterpolateValues()\` and synchronized scalar/vector loaders.
- Interpolated frames retain the requested physical target time and report the two source times plus interpolation weight.
- Per-viewport time badges are now visible for:
  - A / primary;
  - B / View 2;
  - C / View 3;
  - D / View 4;
  - Difference.
- Nearest mode displays \`Δt\`; Interpolated mode displays its lower↔upper source times.

#### Interpolation safety
- FoamLens refuses temporal interpolation instead of fabricating a result when the two bracketing frames are not scientifically compatible.
- Interpolation is rejected if:
  - field association/storage changes;
  - field dimensions change;
  - field array sizes differ;
  - meshes are not equivalent under the existing strict mesh-equivalence check.
- Vector fields use the same synchronization model. Bracketing vector frames are loaded against compatible meshes and each vector component is interpolated independently.
- Decomposed OpenFOAM vector fields continue to use the existing partition reconstruction path before interpolation.

#### Generalized 3D Difference
- Added Difference modes:
  - Signed: \`A − B\`;
  - Absolute: \`|A − B|\`;
  - Percent of primary A: \`100·(A − B)/max(|A|, ε)\`.
- Added configurable percent epsilon \`ε\` to protect near-zero denominators.
- Signed and Percent use a symmetric difference range; Absolute uses a nonnegative range.
- Difference labels now explicitly identify Signed / Absolute / Percent instead of always describing the viewport as signed.
- Difference colormap is mode-aware:
  - Signed / Percent: diverging cool-warm;
  - Absolute: sequential Turbo.

#### Comparison workflow
- Added \`Swap A/B\`.
- Added \`Copy A → B settings\`.
- Copy A→B transfers compatible region / field / component selections and, when visual sync is disabled, primary visual settings into View 2.
- Swap A/B preserves the physical-time reference, changes the primary and comparison cases deterministically, and avoids the former asynchronous component-selection race.
- Ribbon Compare now exposes both workflows directly.

#### Runtime evidence
- WebView2 startup smoke verified:
  - \`syncModes = ["nearest","exact","interpolate"]\`;
  - \`differenceModes = ["signed","absolute","percent"]\`;
  - interpolation smoke at target \`0.25\` between times \`0\` and \`1\` returned \`weight = 0.25\`, \`interpolated = true\`, \`Δt = 0\`;
  - percent-difference smoke for A=10 / B=8 returned \`20\`;
  - View 3 / View 4 time badges mounted.
- Real multi-case packaged smoke executed the public comparison workflows and verified:
  - \`copySettingsApplied = true\`;
  - \`swapApplied = true\`;
  - \`swapRestored = true\`.
- Existing independent-camera, independent-visual, local-legend and Probe-marker smokes continue to pass.

### 2. Thesis / paper multi-panel export

- Added \`desktop/src/FoamLensDesktop/frontend/v16-multipanel-export.js\`.
- Public runtime API: \`window.FoamLensMultiPanelExport\`.
- Automatically discovers available scientific panels from:
  - primary 3D Field View;
  - View 2 / View 3 / View 4;
  - 3D Difference;
  - current 2D plot / Spatial Profile.
- Supports up to four panels in one composition.
- Layout presets:
  - Auto;
  - 1-up;
  - 2-up;
  - 2×2;
  - 3D + Profile.
- Output presets:
  - Thesis \`2400×1600\`;
  - Thesis Hi-Res \`3200×2000\`;
  - Paper \`2400×1800\`;
  - Presentation \`1920×1080\`.
- Multi-panel figures include:
  - A/B/C/D panel labels;
  - case / field / component / time annotations;
  - per-panel scientific range bar and min/max where applicable;
  - optional custom figure title.
- The current plot / Spatial Profile reuses the existing high-resolution export-composition path when available.
- Separate-panel export now uses the same annotated scientific-composition path rather than exporting an unlabeled raw canvas.
- Export is available from the Ribbon \`Export → Multi-panel\`.

#### Runtime evidence
- Packaged and installed WebView2 smoke composed a real two-panel figure from Primary + View 2.
- Verified:
  - \`multiPanelSourceCount = 2\`;
  - width \`2400\`;
  - height \`1600\`;
  - total \`3,840,000\` output pixels.

#### Export boundary
- The final composition canvas is high-resolution.
- 2D plots can be re-rendered through FoamLens's high-resolution plot export path.
- 3D panels are currently sampled from the viewport's existing WebGL canvas. This work does **not** yet provide an arbitrary-resolution offscreen 3D rerender, so the source raster resolution of each 3D panel remains bounded by its rendered viewport.

### 3. Progressive performance, cache telemetry and viewport-aware loading

#### Progressive frame presentation
- Field View now presents the main surface, statistics, legend and time/status first.
- FoamLens then yields through \`requestAnimationFrame\` so the browser can paint before constructing heavier derived geometry.
- Slice / Iso are built after that paint opportunity.
- Streamlines and prefetch continue after the main frame presentation.
- The existing frame sequence guard is re-checked after the yield, so stale frame work is still cancelled.

#### Adaptive prefetch
- Added \`desktop/src/FoamLensDesktop/frontend/v16-progressive-performance.js\`.
- Prefetch detects navigation direction instead of always loading a fixed neighboring pattern.
- Prefetch depth adapts to observed frame latency:
  - slower frame history → more frames ahead;
  - faster frame history → smaller look-ahead.
- One frame behind the current navigation direction remains eligible for quick reversal.
- Prefetch uses the existing field cache (\`fvLoadFieldSetCached\`) rather than maintaining a duplicate cache.
- Idle scheduling uses \`requestIdleCallback\` where available, with a non-blocking fallback.
- Prefetch is cancelled when Field Workspace is hidden or when the document becomes hidden.

#### Viewport-aware loading
- Visible additional 3D comparison viewports are refreshed concurrently.
- Off-screen additional views are deferred to idle work.
- Video export deliberately bypasses that optimization and uses the exhaustive original refresh path so exported frames are complete.

#### Telemetry
- Added a \`Performance / cache\` panel and Ribbon \`View → Performance\`.
- Telemetry includes:
  - last frame time;
  - average frame time;
  - prefetch hit rate;
  - mesh reuse / mesh build counts;
  - field-cache entries / memory;
  - deferred viewport count.
- Existing GPU/mesh buffers continue to be reused when the mesh remains unchanged; the new work exposes and measures that reuse rather than claiming a separate GPU architecture.

#### Real-case runtime evidence
- Run #539 packaged smoke on the B13-derived runtime fixture reported:
  - \`performancePanelMounted = true\`;
  - \`performanceLoads = 6\`;
  - \`performanceCacheEntries = 4\`;
  - portable \`performanceLastMs ≈ 507.7 ms\`;
  - portable \`performanceAvgMs ≈ 2085.35 ms\`.
- Installed smoke reported approximately:
  - \`performanceLoads = 6\`;
  - \`performanceCacheEntries = 4\`;
  - \`performanceLastMs ≈ 520.9 ms\`;
  - \`performanceAvgMs ≈ 2017.45 ms\`.
- These numbers are runtime telemetry from the smoke sequence, **not** a controlled before/after benchmark and must not be presented as a measured percentage speedup.

### Ribbon integration
- Compare:
  - Swap A/B;
  - Copy A→B.
- Export:
  - Multi-panel.
- View:
  - Performance.

### Automated coverage
- Updated \`desktop/tests/field-compare.test.cjs\` to cover:
  - exact / nearest / interpolated physical-time resolution;
  - interpolation bracketing and weights;
  - rejection outside the available time range;
  - safe scalar and vector interpolation guards;
  - signed / absolute / percent differences;
  - epsilon protection;
  - mode-specific ranges / palettes;
  - per-viewport time badges;
  - Swap A/B and Copy A→B workflow exposure.
- Added \`desktop/tests/multipanel-performance.test.cjs\` covering:
  - multipanel source discovery and composition;
  - Thesis / Paper / Presentation presets;
  - 1-up / 2-up / 2×2 / 3D+Profile layouts;
  - scientific labels / ranges;
  - annotated individual-panel export;
  - progressive rendering yield ordering;
  - stale-frame cancellation;
  - direction-aware adaptive prefetch;
  - cache telemetry;
  - viewport-aware loading;
  - exhaustive video-export exception;
  - ribbon discoverability.
- Workflow now runs **60** scientific/UI regression steps before packaging.

### Regression / validation history
- Early runs #522–#529 were development checkpoints while implementation and exact-source tests were changing.
- Run #529 reached the strict 3D Difference test; the remaining failure was a stale assertion requiring \`coolwarm\` for every Difference mode. The product had intentionally become mode-aware, using Turbo for Absolute and cool-warm for Signed/Percent.
- The regression was updated to require the mode-aware behavior rather than the obsolete fixed palette.
- Run #532 then completed the full 60-test suite, portable smoke, installer smoke and artifact upload successfully with interpolation, multipanel and performance runtime checks.
- Run #538 completed successfully after final comparison-label and annotated-export refinements.
- Run #539 strengthened the packaged runtime smoke again by actually executing Copy A→B, Swap A/B, and Swap back to the original state. All three operations passed in the portable and installed application.

### Final validation
- GitHub Actions run **#539** (\`37110806229\`): **SUCCESS**.

### Remaining scientific / performance boundaries
- Streamline path-by-path comparison against ParaView/VTK remains pending; the streamline module should not yet be described as ParaView-equivalent.
- Progressive-performance mechanisms are active and instrumented, but no controlled before/after benchmark has been run, so no quantitative speedup claim is warranted.
- High-resolution multipanel composition does not yet rerender WebGL 3D scenes offscreen at arbitrary export resolution.

### State
- **v1.4.9 is now the current public FoamLens Desktop release.**
- Release is not marked draft or prerelease.

## 2026-10-05 — v1.5.0 validation/export/performance boundaries closed

- Development branch: \`development/v1.5.0-validation-export-benchmark\`.
- Validated product head: \`01845b0bce089c910dfd054c380724ab1638f6cf\`.
- Public release remains **FoamLens Desktop v1.4.9**. No version bump, merge to \`main\`, or public release was performed.
- This development line closes the three scientific / export / performance boundaries left explicitly open after v1.4.9:
  1. independent streamline geometry validation against VTK;
  2. true high-resolution WebGL 3D rerendering for multipanel export;
  3. controlled baseline-vs-optimized performance benchmarking.

### 1. Independent streamline validation against VTK

#### Reference implementation
- Added \`desktop/tests/streamline-vtk-reference-input.cjs\` to generate deterministic B13 streamline inputs directly from the real OpenFOAM mesh and \`U\` field.
- Added \`desktop/tests/vtk_streamline_reference.py\` using:
  - VTK 9.7.1;
  - \`vtkOpenFOAMReader\`;
  - \`vtkCellDataToPointData\`;
  - \`vtkStreamTracer\`;
  - Runge-Kutta 2;
  - the same fixed integration step and directional propagation budget used by FoamLens.
- The workflow installs VTK independently and produces a retained \`FoamLens-VTK-streamline-validation\` artifact.

#### FoamLens sampling refinement
- Field View now exposes mesh-aware vector interpolation for streamline integration:
  - cell→point vector reconstruction;
  - tetrahedral local interpolation;
  - explicit containing-cell lookup;
  - reusable mesh vector sampler.
- Streamline integration keeps the existing RK2 trajectory integration but can now consume the mesh-aware sampler instead of the older nearest/IDW-only path.

#### VTK Both-direction topology correction
- Diagnostic runs #614–#623 showed that VTK \`IntegrationDirection=Both\` returns **two output polyline cells per seed** (forward and backward), while FoamLens exposes one combined bidirectional polyline.
- The initial validator was therefore comparing one FoamLens combined path against one VTK directional branch and produced misleading Hausdorff errors despite near-identical path lengths.
- Run #624 corrects the comparison without relaxing thresholds:
  - raw VTK output: 16 lines for 8 seeds;
  - VTK forward/backward branches are paired by seed and combined into 8 bidirectional paths;
  - VTK maximum propagation uses the same effective per-direction fixed-step budget as FoamLens;
  - FoamLens path i is compared directly against the reconstructed VTK path for the same seed.

#### B13 validation result
- Case: real B13-derived OpenFOAM fixture.
- Region: \`metal\`.
- Field: \`U\`.
- Physical time: \`9.8 s\`.
- Compared deterministic seed paths: **8**.
- Effective propagation per direction: \`0.022748468080290594 m\`.
- VTK raw lines: **16**.
- Reconstructed VTK bidirectional lines: **8**.
- Metrics normalized by domain diagonal:
  - mean RMS distance: \`0.001079412105434675\`;
  - worst RMS distance: \`0.005370900274556226\`;
  - worst Hausdorff distance: \`0.012707557766339842\`;
  - mean relative path-length difference: \`1.4196553839305338e-08\`.
- Validation thresholds remained:
  - mean RMS / diagonal ≤ \`0.06\`;
  - worst RMS / diagonal ≤ \`0.10\`;
  - worst Hausdorff / diagonal ≤ \`0.16\`;
  - mean relative length difference ≤ \`0.35\`.
- Result: **PASS**.
- This closes the previous “not independently VTK-validated” boundary for the representative B13 validation configuration. It should still not be generalized to every possible ParaView integration/interpolation setting without matching those settings explicitly.

### 2. True high-resolution 3D multipanel rendering

- Primary Field View renderer now accepts an explicit render size.
- View 2, Difference, and extra comparison views also accept explicit render sizes.
- Public runtime APIs:
  - \`FoamLensFieldView.renderAtSize(width,height)\`;
  - \`FoamLensFieldCompare.renderAtSize(key,width,height)\`.
- \`v16-multipanel-export.js\` now rerenders WebGL 3D sources at the target panel pixel dimensions before composition instead of scaling the existing low-resolution viewport raster.
- After each export render, the original viewport pixel dimensions are restored in a \`finally\` path.

#### Runtime evidence
- Portable packaged smoke requested a primary 3D rerender at **1800×1200**.
- Installed-app smoke repeated the same operation.
- Both reported:
  - \`hiRes3DWidth = 1800\`;
  - \`hiRes3DHeight = 1200\`;
  - \`highResRerendered = true\`;
  - \`primaryRestored = true\`.
- The resulting two-panel scientific composition remained **2400×1600 = 3,840,000 pixels**.
- Existing case/field labels, legend, Probe and independent-view behavior continued to pass after the high-resolution render/restore cycle.

### 3. Controlled performance A/B benchmark

#### Benchmark method
- Added explicit runtime modes:
  - \`baseline\`;
  - \`optimized\`.
- Baseline disables the optimizations being measured:
  - progressive browser-paint yield;
  - adaptive field prefetch;
  - viewport-aware deferred comparison-view loading.
- Optimized mode enables those behaviors.
- Each pass:
  - uses the same stored field-frame sequence;
  - clears FoamLens field cache / inflight state;
  - resets pass telemetry.
- Two rounds alternate execution order:
  - round 1: baseline → optimized;
  - round 2: optimized → baseline.
- Packaged smoke uses 3 frames × 2 rounds = **6 baseline samples + 6 optimized samples**.
- Report schema: \`foamlens-performance-ab-v1\`.
- The smoke requires finite metrics but does **not** require a positive speedup; measured results are reported as observed.

#### Portable Windows smoke result
- Baseline mean: \`725.5666666667288 ms\`.
- Optimized mean: \`671.3166666666511 ms\`.
- Baseline median: \`673.5000000001164 ms\`.
- Optimized median: \`652.1999999999534 ms\`.
- Baseline p95: \`911.5 ms\`.
- Optimized p95: \`744.6999999999534 ms\`.
- Speedup factor: \`1.0808113408973592×\`.
- Mean-time reduction: **7.476914595498646%**.

#### Installed-app smoke result
- Baseline mean: \`740.4166666666279 ms\`.
- Optimized mean: \`677.75 ms\`.
- Baseline median: \`725.75 ms\`.
- Optimized median: \`671.8999999999069 ms\`.
- Baseline p95: \`1005 ms\`.
- Optimized p95: \`776.3000000000466 ms\`.
- Speedup factor: \`1.0924628058526415×\`.
- Mean-time reduction: **8.46370287000083%**.

#### Interpretation boundary
- The benchmark demonstrates a repeatable improvement under the B13 smoke workload on GitHub-hosted Windows runners.
- These percentages are **not** claimed as universal application speedups; different hardware, cases, fields, viewport layouts and cache states may produce different results.

### Automated / runtime validation
- GitHub Actions run **#624** (\`37296824298\`): **SUCCESS**.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Independent B13 VTK streamline comparison: **SUCCESS**.

- Installer build: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-application smoke including benchmark and high-resolution WebGL rerender: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- GitHub Release publication: **SKIPPED**, expected for a development branch.

### State
- The three previously explicit boundaries are now closed on this development branch:
  - representative B13 streamline geometry independently validated against VTK;
  - 3D WebGL export rerendered at requested high-resolution pixel dimensions;
  - controlled before/after performance benchmark executed and measured.
- No merge to \`main\`.
- No new public release.
- Public FoamLens release remains **v1.4.9**.

## 2026-10-05 — persistent workspace UX validated

- Development branch: `development/v1.5.0-validation-export-benchmark`.
- Validated product head: `a97d26f33c01c34eafba2d4ab3c6f931798452df`.
- Public release remains **FoamLens Desktop v1.4.9**. No merge to `main` and no public release were performed.

### Persistent Field Workspace
- Added `v17-workspace-ux.js`.
- FoamLens now stores/restores locally:
  - Split / 3D focus / Plot focus layout;
  - companion plot selection;
  - physical-time follow toggle;
  - comparison enabled state and visible comparison-view count;
  - Difference enabled state and time-sync mode;
  - linked/independent camera state;
  - linked/independent visual-settings state;
  - per-view display names A–D;
  - draggable panel sizes.
- Added Reset layout, which restores the predictable Split + Spatial Profile + linked-camera/visual defaults without modifying OpenFOAM data.

### Per-view names / provenance preservation
- Views A–D may be renamed for presentation use.
- Presentation labels are prepended to, rather than substituted for, the scientific case / field / time labels.
- The implementation keeps the original scientific label in dedicated dataset attributes before applying an alias, preventing repeated refreshes from progressively stripping provenance.

### Comparison status strip
- Added an always-visible comparison summary while Compare 3D is active.
- It reports:
  - A and B case/time context;
  - Exact / Nearest / Interpolated time state and Δt where relevant;
  - same/different physical quantity compatibility;
  - linked/independent cameras;
  - linked/independent visual settings;
  - Difference mode;
  - selected synchronization mode.

### Contextual help / discoverability
- Added `v18-context-help-resize.js`.
- Added Ribbon **View → Help** plus the `?` keyboard shortcut.
- Contextual help covers:
  - Field Workspace;
  - 3D Compare;
  - Scientific Export;
  - View & Layout.
- Escape closes the overlay.
- Help explicitly documents Exact / Nearest / Interpolated sync, comparison status, high-resolution 3D export, view-name semantics and splitter behavior.

### Resizable workspace panels
- Added two draggable vertical splitters:
  - 3D ↔ companion plot;
  - companion plot ↔ controls.
- Minimum widths protect scientific readability:
  - 3D: 280 px;
  - companion plot: 280 px;
  - controls: 260 px.
- Splitter sizes persist in the same Field Workspace state.
- At responsive widths ≤1100 px, splitters are disabled and the workspace stacks vertically instead of forcing desktop dimensions.

### Ribbon integration
- View tab now exposes:
  - View names;
  - Reset layout;
  - Help.
- Existing Performance / Fit / Sidebar / appearance controls remain intact.

### Automated/runtime validation
- Added `desktop/tests/workspace-ux.test.cjs`.
- Added `desktop/tests/context-help-resize.test.cjs`.
- CI suite increased from 60 to **62** tests and the manifest verifies each test runs exactly once.
- Packaged WebView2 runtime smoke now requires:
  - `uxViewNamesPanel`;
  - `uxComparisonStatus`;
  - `uxSplitterA`;
  - `uxSplitterB`;
  - `hrHelpOverlay`;
  - live `FoamLensWorkspaceUx`, `FoamLensWorkspaceResize` and `FoamLensContextHelp` APIs;
  - exactly two workspace splitters.
- GitHub Actions run **#651** (`37303650253`): **SUCCESS**.
- Real QuickCup/B13 regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Independent VTK streamline validation: **SUCCESS**.
- Full 62-test scientific/UI suite: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable build and packaged WebView2 smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build and installed-app smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- GitHub Release publication: **SKIPPED**, expected for a development branch.

### State
- The P2 Workspace / usability items recorded in the original post-v1.4.5 roadmap are now materially closed:
  - persistent layout;
  - per-view naming;
  - compact comparison status;
  - interaction/help discoverability;
  - resizable Field Workspace panels.
- The next incomplete P0 block is vector-glyph analysis: normalized/proportional length, ROI sampling and quantitative sampling validation.

## 2026-10-05 — Infrastructure / cloud audit

Added `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT.md`.

FoamLens remains intentionally local-first for scientific case data. No Google/Supabase backend is required for core analysis. Current infrastructure priorities are automatic updates, version/license reconciliation, shared About migration and preservation of current-HEAD CI validation. Any future cloud feature must be opt-in and must not silently upload OpenFOAM case data.

## 2026-10-05 — Michel's Lab parent/child governance contract

Added the repository-level Michel's Lab governance declaration:

- `.michelslab/project.yml` identifies `realmichelduarte/Michel-Software-Standards` as the shared standards authority.
- `MICHELS_LAB_PROJECT.md` documents the human-readable reporting contract.
- App-specific implementation evidence remains in this repository.
- Reusable/cross-app decisions are promoted to the master standards repository.
- The master repository polls child status centrally; this repository receives no credential that can write to the master.
- Secret values remain prohibited from both repositories.

## 2026-10-05 — v1.5.0 vector analysis + scientific provenance development

- Development branch: `development/v1.5.0-vector-provenance`.
- Base: current public `main` after FoamLens Desktop v1.4.9 publication.
- This block addresses remaining roadmap items under **Vector glyph analysis controls** and **Scientific provenance in the viewport**.

### Implemented
- Added isolated frontend module: `desktop/src/FoamLensDesktop/frontend/v17-vector-analysis.js`.
- Added vector arrow-length semantics:
  - `Magnitude-proportional`;
  - `Normalized / equal length`.
- Added normalized ROI-box sampling controls for X/Y/Z.
- ROI sampling filters candidate cell centers before glyph selection; cells outside the ROI are not eligible.
- Vector metadata now reports:
  - actual glyph count;
  - requested glyph count;
  - eligible ROI-cell count;
  - length mode;
  - ROI bounds;
  - sampled mean magnitude / ROI-field mean magnitude;
  - sampled magnitude-range coverage.
- Added scientific provenance overlay to the primary 3D viewport.
- Added provenance overlays to synchronized View 2 / View 3 / View 4.
- Provenance exposes case, region, field, association, unit when available, physical time, dimensions, synchronization context for comparison views, parser/reconstruction context and source identity.
- Existing v1.4.9 Field View engine remains intact; v17 extends the already-validated module rather than rewriting v14.

### Regression coverage
- Added `desktop/tests/vector-analysis.test.cjs`.
- Workflow now executes the vector-analysis regression exactly once.
- The existing CI manifest will require the new test to remain wired because it checks every `.test.cjs` file against the workflow.

### Direct validation on repository content
- v17 JavaScript syntax validation: **PASS**.
- ROI test with normalized X bounds `0.5–1.0`: selected only cells inside the requested ROI.
- Normalized-length test: two different vector magnitudes produced equal glyph shaft lengths.
- Magnitude-proportional test: the larger vector produced a longer glyph shaft.
- Comparison provenance tokens for A/B/C/D are present.
- Workflow reference count for `vector-analysis.test.cjs`: exactly **1**.

### Validation status
- Latest full CI head: `b6bc2a5e0b10c0df057b0b6a23e4462e8b67e4ae`.
- GitHub Actions run **#664** (`37371845965`) was queued at the time of this log entry.
- This block is **implemented but not yet marked fully validated** until the complete QuickCup + Windows packaging workflow passes.
- No merge to `main`.
- No release created.

## 2026-10-05 — v1.5.0 unified integration candidate

- Integration branch: `integration/v1.5.0-unified`.
- Base block: validated VTK streamline / high-resolution export / controlled performance benchmark / workspace UX branch.
- Integrated block: vector glyph ROI + normalized/proportional length semantics + quantitative sampling metrics + scientific provenance overlays + Michel's Lab governance/infrastructure declarations.
- CI workflow now retains independent VTK validation and also runs `vector-analysis.test.cjs` exactly once.
- No merge to `main` and no public release at this stage; full unified CI validation is required first.

## 2026-10-05 — v1.5.0 CI version-transition incident

The Michel's Lab master governance audit surfaced FoamLens CI as red during the Desktop v1.5.0 release transition.

Evidence:
- failed Windows build runs stopped at `desktop/tests/version-consistency.test.cjs`;
- the failing assertion still expected Desktop `1.4.9` while release work had already advanced the project to `1.5.0`;
- the current default-branch version-consistency test now expects Desktop `1.5.0` and the README identifies Desktop v1.5.0 / frontend v51;
- a newer v1.5.0 workflow run completed successfully;
- the final main-branch publication workflow was still running at the time of this audit note.

Impact:
- the earlier red runs represent an intermediate release-transition mismatch, not evidence that the scientific regression suite itself failed;
- no additional conflicting code patch was applied while the v1.5.0 publication pipeline was active.

Status: **fix present / final main publication validation pending**.

- The earlier release-transition note that said final publication validation was pending is superseded by run #674.
- There are no open GitHub issues at release closure.


## 2026-10-05 — v1.5.1 verified automatic updater candidate

- Development branch: `development/v1.5.1-auto-update`.
- Public release at candidate creation: **FoamLens Desktop v1.5.0**.
- Candidate Desktop version: **v1.5.1**.
- Purpose: close the infrastructure audit item for an in-app update path without introducing a cloud backend for scientific case data.

### Implemented
- Normal Desktop startup performs a non-blocking query to the official `realmichelduarte/FoamLens` latest GitHub Release endpoint.
- Semantic version comparison suppresses prompts unless the public release is newer than the installed Desktop build.
- Added a manual **Updates / Actualizaciones** Ribbon action.
- The native updater requires both:
  - `FoamLens-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe`;
  - `FoamLens-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe.sha256`.
- The installer is downloaded to the user-local FoamLens update cache and verified with SHA-256 before launch.
- A checksum mismatch fails closed; the installer is not launched.
- After a verified installer is started, FoamLens closes so the installer can replace the application cleanly.
- Automatic network checking is disabled during packaged smoke tests.
- Update traffic is limited to public GitHub Release metadata/assets; no OpenFOAM project or simulation data are uploaded.

### Release-pipeline hardening
- CI now creates a SHA-256 file for the installer **after optional Authenticode signing**, so the checksum represents the final distributed binary.
- The installer checksum is included in both the Windows Actions artifact and GitHub Release assets.
- Added `desktop/tests/auto-update.test.cjs` and wired it exactly once into the CI suite manifest.
- Packaged WebView2 smoke now requires the updater Ribbon action and `FoamLensAutoUpdate` frontend API to be mounted.

### Validation state
- Final versioned candidate workflow: GitHub Actions run **#684** (`37378777465`) was running at the time of this entry.
- No merge to `main` and no v1.5.1 public release should occur until the full QuickCup + VTK + Windows portable/installer pipeline is green.


## 2026-10-05 — v1.5.1 automatic updater candidate validated

- Functional candidate head: `ad68941e28cc4a41776cb8058185ab4a675decee`.
- GitHub Actions run **#686** (`37379049218`): **SUCCESS**.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Independent B13 VTK streamline validation: **SUCCESS**.
- Version consistency for Desktop v1.5.1: **SUCCESS**.
- Native automatic-update regression: **SUCCESS**.
- CI suite manifest: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows executable build: **SUCCESS**.
- Packaged portable WebView2 smoke, including updater Ribbon action/API: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable SHA-256 generation: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer SHA-256 generation: **SUCCESS**.
- Installed-application smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Windows artifact upload: **SUCCESS**.
- GitHub Release publication: **SKIPPED**, expected for a development branch.

### Integration correction evidence
- Run #675 was an intermediate integration run: the native smoke test correctly rejected the build because the updater Ribbon module had not yet been added (`flRaCheckUpdates` / `FoamLensAutoUpdate` missing).
- The missing frontend updater module was added immediately afterward; subsequent packaged smoke validation passed.
- Runs during the 1.5.0 → 1.5.1 version-file transition that failed version-consistency checks are superseded by final run #686.

### Promotion state
- PR #11 is the promotion path to `main`.
- The functional candidate is validated and ready for promotion.
- Public v1.5.1 release remains pending the final main-branch publication workflow.

### Automatic-update state
- **FoamLens Desktop v1.5.1 is now the current public release.**
- v1.5.1 checks the official FoamLens GitHub Releases endpoint in the background and also exposes a manual **Updates / Actualizaciones** action.
- Newer installers are offered only after semantic-version comparison and explicit user approval.
- The updater downloads the matching installer checksum and verifies SHA-256 before launching the installer; checksum mismatch fails closed.
- Update checks do not upload OpenFOAM project or simulation data.
- v1.5.0 predates the updater, so moving from v1.5.0 to v1.5.1 is the one-time manual bridge; future releases can be discovered from inside FoamLens.


## 2026-10-05 — UX / information-architecture coherence audit

- Audit branch: `audit/ux-coherence-2026-10-05`.
- Audited baseline: FoamLens Desktop **v1.5.1**, main commit `275427b61ad848c98e351dfb4c6df5a310f5a964`.
- Full report: `docs/UX_COHERENCE_AUDIT_2026-10-05.md`.

### Runtime issues reported and included
- overlapping progress/activity cards during folder/background operations;
- persistent PROJECT / CASE / REGION strip appears ineffective in Field Workspace and wastes vertical space;
- 3D Focus does not reclaim the full content area;
- separate 3D and Spatial Profile playback controls conflict with the desired single global physical-time controller;
- Field Workspace defaults to simultaneous 3D + companion panels instead of one central tabbed view with explicit Split;
- 3D comparison configuration appears in Data even though it belongs to Field/Compare.

### Source-level root causes confirmed
- Field View still contains its legacy identity as a Data dataset tab.
- Field Workspace reparents legacy Data DOM nodes with `fwMove` / `fwRestore` rather than owning independent section UI.
- 3D Compare is injected into generic `fieldViewControls`.
- 3D Focus CSS deliberately keeps a ~340 px controls column.
- Profile and 3D use independent playback engines/timers, with an additional Field synchronization layer.
- Data and Plots Ribbon actions route to the same underlying legacy dataset tabs.
- Compare Ribbon routes through Field rather than owning a separate surface.
- the original monolithic sidebar contains controls for many unrelated modes.
- Data and Analysis share the same core `#workspace`.
- several analysis modules can fall back to generic `.analysisTools` or `document.body` mount points.
- multi-region context is directly coupled to the persistent global Case/Region DOM controls.

### Regression conflicts found
- `ribbon-ui.test.cjs` requires the rejected `globalContextBar`.
- `workspace-ux.test.cjs` requires Reset Layout to restore `split + profile`.
- `context-help-resize.test.cjs` requires the permanent 3D / plot / controls splitter model.
- packaged runtime smoke in `Program.cs` requires 3D + Spatial Profile to remain mounted together.

### Audit conclusion
- **Status: NEEDS STRUCTURAL UX REFACTOR.**
- A CSS-only patch is explicitly rejected as insufficient because tests and ownership rules encode the old architecture.
- Scientific parsing, VTK validation, field reconstruction and numerical-analysis logic were not identified as the cause of these UX issues.
- Recommended development target: **v1.6.0** because the correction changes the information architecture and interaction model.
- No functional code was changed as part of this audit.


## 2026-10-05 — Whole-app cross-scope UX audit extension

- Branch: `development/v1.6.0-ux-coherence`.
- The audit was expanded from the reported Field/Data defects to the complete Desktop frontend module set and the primary UX regression tests.
- Important correction: Project / Case / Region is **not obsolete**. It is useful for Profiles/Data/Logs and analysis context, but its persistent presentation in pure 3D / Field and unrelated modes is incorrect.

### Additional cross-scope findings
- Data Catalog still shares sidebar cards intended for plot editing (Figure, Selected curve, Phase-change, Reference lines).
- Reference Lines combines controls whose applicability depends on the active data view.
- Analysis and Data share the same core workspace/sidebar, so Analysis inherits unrelated Data/plot presentation controls.
- Several analysis modules create derived results by silently switching the hidden underlying Data view to Time Series or Profile.
- Profile playback, legacy `playbackGlobal` and 3D playback are separate presentation engines for the same physical-time concept.
- Field extensions such as Compare, Animation/Video and performance tooling are valid, but are structurally children of legacy Data-owned `fieldViewControls`, allowing leakage if reparent/hide state becomes inconsistent.
- Ribbon Plots is currently a second doorway into Data rather than a distinct workspace.
- Ribbon Compare is currently a second doorway into Field rather than a distinct workspace.
- Legacy Data/Field navigation shims remain active under the newer Ribbon/Field Workspace model.
- Several analysis modules can fall back to generic `.analysisTools` or `document.body` if the intended host is unavailable.

### Updated refactor rule
- Do not remove useful controls merely because they are irrelevant in one tab.
- Preserve shared scientific/application state.
- Scope the presentation to the views that actually consume that state.
- Remove only genuinely duplicate/legacy navigation after equivalent owned surfaces are validated.

### Documentation
- Extended `docs/UX_COHERENCE_AUDIT_2026-10-05.md` with findings UX-18 through UX-29 and the updated scope rule.


## 2026-10-05 — v1.6.0 UX coherence implementation

- Branch: `development/v1.6.0-ux-coherence`.
- Baseline: public FoamLens Desktop v1.5.1.
- Scope: resolve the UX ownership defects documented in `docs/UX_COHERENCE_AUDIT_2026-10-05.md` without changing OpenFOAM parsing or scientific kernels.

### Implemented so far
- Field Workspace default changed from permanent 3D + companion Split to a single **3D** central view.
- Added internal Field tabs: **3D / Spatial Profile / Time Series / Solver Logs / Split**.
- Split is now explicit and owns only one 3D/plot divider.
- 3D Focus no longer reserves a permanent controls column.
- Detailed Field controls moved to a floating Inspector drawer.
- Inspector content is scoped: pure 3D shows 3D controls, plot/log views show companion controls, Split can show both.
- Added one visible physical-time transport in Field; legacy 3D/Profile/Log engines remain internal.
- The global Field transport now selects the physical-time source from the active view (3D, Spatial Profile or Solver Logs).
- PROJECT / CASE / REGION state is preserved, but its Ribbon presentation is contextual:
  - visible for Data and Analysis;
  - visible for Field Profile / Time Series / Solver Logs / Split;
  - hidden for pure 3D and unrelated surfaces.
- Removed top-level Ribbon alias tabs **Plots** and **Compare**.
- Compare tools remain available contextually inside Field.
- Preserved **Copy A→B** after CI identified it as a valid comparison action.
- Data now opens the Data Catalog instead of silently reusing a legacy plot view.
- Legacy dataset tabs are hidden under the v1.6 Ribbon so they no longer compete with Field's internal view tabs.
- Sidebar sections are scoped to their actual workflow:
  - Catalog does not show Figure / Selected Curve / Phase-change / Reference Lines;
  - Analysis does not inherit legacy Data/plot cards;
  - Phase-change / Reference Lines appear only in compatible Time Series / Profile contexts.
- Flow, Numerical Performance, Physical Analysis, Solidification, Spatial Difference, Temporal Alignment, Thermal Analysis and Vector Derived Fields no longer fall back to `document.body`; they mount only in their owned analysis hosts.
- Added a unified activity presentation policy: compact activity toast is suppressed while a detailed modal/scan overlay owns progress.
- Field Ribbon 3D-only actions (Probe, Slice, Vectors, Streamlines, 3D Compare, Camera tools) are hidden while Profile / Time Series / Solver Logs is the active internal view and return in 3D / Split.

- Findings review now supports a portable evidence handoff:
  - **Assistant bundle (.md)** with review instructions, findings table and per-case configuration/run evidence.
  - **Raw evidence (.json)** with structured findings, measured/reference values, targets, case metadata, output completeness, dataset provenance and related evidence.
  - **Copy for ChatGPT** copies the assistant-ready review prompt/bundle and opens ChatGPT in the default browser.
  - **Create GitHub issue** opens a prefilled FoamLens issue containing workspace health counts and highest-priority findings.
- The Windows host now exposes a minimal `openExternal` bridge restricted to `http/https`; FoamLens stores no ChatGPT or GitHub credentials for these handoffs.

### Regression contract changes
- Packaged smoke no longer requires permanent 3D + Spatial Profile mounting.
- Packaged smoke now requires:
  - six real top-level Ribbon tabs;
  - internal Field view tabs;
  - single-view 3D default;
  - hidden companion in 3D focus;
  - hidden Inspector in default 3D focus;
  - PROJECT / CASE / REGION hidden in 3D and visible in Profile.
- Workspace, Ribbon, Field View, playback, resize/help and sidebar regression tests were updated to enforce the v1.6 interaction model.

### Validation state
- Intermediate CI caught and corrected:
  - removal of valid Copy A→B comparison workflow;
  - asynchronous context refresh causing Profile context to appear one tick late;
  - stale packaged-smoke expectations for the removed second workspace splitter.
- Final functional candidate commit: `2bbfdcd200bcb44c411b530e403bb5e241434b41`.
- GitHub Actions run **#743** (`37392625734`) completed **SUCCESS**.
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: PASS.
- Independent VTK B13 streamline validation: PASS.
- Full regression suite, including Review/Findings export, Analysis UI organization, Ribbon/workspace scope, scientific field handling and bilingual/overflow checks: PASS.
- Portable Windows executable smoke: PASS.
- Installer build + install smoke: PASS.
- Windows artifact: `FoamLens-Windows-v1.5.1`, artifact id `11381219665`, digest `sha256:ed8b3f4ea23b60ac6955b0a1815ff006e5ff7efde6afb11e7a0aa438267b1542`.

- GitHub Release publication was correctly skipped because this is a development branch.
- **No merge to main and no v1.6.0 public release yet.**

## 2026-10-05 — v1.6.0 permanent Field ownership phase validated

- Branch: `development/v1.6.0-ux-coherence`.
- Validated product head: `84fb85ca3f28591ec4ad59e786997131bcb4eb65`.
- GitHub Actions run **#747** (`37396621308`): **SUCCESS**.
- Structural correction: the core 3D Field View panel and its controls are now adopted by the Field Workspace once and remain Field-owned across top-level section changes.
- `fwLeave()` no longer restores `fieldViewPanel` or `fieldViewControls` into the legacy Data tree.
- Added `fwAdoptFieldNode()` plus regression coverage that forbids restoring the 3D panel/control tree back into Data.
- Historical Field View regressions were updated from the obsolete `fwMove(...)` contract to the new permanent-ownership contract.
- Scope deliberately kept surgical: the shared 2D chart plus Profile / Time Series / Solver Log control trees still use compatibility reparenting because Analysis and legacy plot rendering currently share that chart path. Their separation is the next structural block and was not mixed into this change.

### Validation evidence
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Independent B13 VTK streamline validation: **SUCCESS**.
- 3D OpenFOAM Field View regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Persistent Field Workspace UX regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Contextual help / Split resizing regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Ribbon/context/activity scope regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Analysis UI organization regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Bilingual / overflow hardening: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows executable build + packaged runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.

- No merge to `main` and no v1.6.0 release were performed.



## 2026-10-05 — v1.6.0 Field ownership / navigation coherence phase validated

- Development branch: `development/v1.6.0-ux-coherence`.
- Validated product head: `2b0e54c31e3dc0a6fa48b2b33a5c90fa1ee9bca2`.
- GitHub Actions run **#782** (`37409195436`): **SUCCESS**.
- No merge to `main` and no v1.6.0 public release were performed.

### Structural ownership closed
- Core 3D UI is now permanently Field-owned:
  - `fieldViewPanel` stays under `fw3DHost`;
  - `fieldViewControls` stays under `fw3DControlsHost`;
  - leaving Field no longer restores either tree into Data.
- Profile / Time Series / Solver Log control trees are also permanently Field-owned.
- The only remaining compatibility reparenting is the singleton 2D `.chartwrap`, because Data/Analysis/Field still share the legacy interactive 2D renderer.
- A cross-section ownership regression now fails if 3D/Compare/control trees leak back into Data, if Analysis modules fall back to `document.body`, or if fake top-level Plots/Compare tabs return.

### Legacy Field navigation retired
- Field View no longer creates a legacy Data `fieldViewTab`.
- The hidden legacy `modeField` button is removed after Ribbon installation.
- Ribbon Field no longer falls back to clicking `modeField`.
- The old `setDataView('field3d')` path and its Data-view wrappers were removed.
- Official Field entry points are now:
  - the `3D / Field` Ribbon tab;
  - the Overview `Open 3D Field View` action.
- Packaged smoke explicitly requires the Ribbon/Field surface and requires legacy Field button/dataset-tab navigation to be absent.

### Context and Analysis ownership
- Added `window.FoamLensContextStore` so Case/Region state is independent of `globalCaseSelect/globalRegionSelect`.
- Shared context selectors are now a presentation of the store; series filtering reads the context state rather than selector DOM.
- Analysis-derived curve creation is navigation-neutral: analysis modules no longer call `setDataView('timeseries')` or `setDataView('profile')`.
- Analysis Ribbon now exposes explicit **Open Time Series** and **Open Spatial Profile** result handoffs.
- Difference wording is explicit:
  - **2D Curve Δ** / **2D Curve Difference** for curve analysis;
  - **Strict 3D Δ** for field comparison.

### Validation evidence
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Independent B13 VTK streamline validation: **SUCCESS**.
- Full 57-test manifest: **SUCCESS**, each test executed exactly once.
- Field View / permanent ownership / Ribbon navigation regressions: **SUCCESS**.
- Section ownership / anti-leak regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Multi-region context-store regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Analysis UI organization + navigation-neutral result regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Bilingual / overflow regressions: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows executable build + packaged runtime smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build + installed-application smoke: **SUCCESS**.

### Remaining structural boundary
- The singleton interactive 2D chart remains shared by Data / Analysis / Field. Separating it requires preserving the existing hover, pins, legend drag/resize, export and plot interaction semantics; this is intentionally left as the next isolated architecture block rather than replacing safe ownership work with a fragile overlay.


## 2026-10-06 — v1.6.0 stable 2D Plot Surface architecture validated

- Development branch: `development/v1.6.0-ux-coherence`.
- Validated product head: `48599763a1c8bdbe9b6445f5ee361c88f9c91e7b`.
- GitHub Actions run **#792** (`37424239577`): **SUCCESS**.
- No merge to `main` and no v1.6.0 public release were performed.

### Final shared-renderer bridge removed
- Added `v14-zy-plot-surfaces.js` with a single `FoamLensPlotSurfaces` controller.
- Data, Analysis and Field now own three persistent `.chartwrap` surfaces:
  - Data → `#chartViewport`;
  - Analysis → `#chartViewport`;
  - Field → `#fw2DHost`.
- Surface changes no longer move a chart node between workspaces.
- The existing scientific renderer remains single-source: `draw()`, `renderExportComposition()`, plot-state calculations and export code are reused rather than copied.
- Legacy compatibility is maintained by switching the canonical internal IDs (`canvas`, `tooltip`, `canvasSelection`, `previewBadge`, etc.) to the active stable surface. Inactive surfaces keep scoped IDs.
- `bindPlotCanvasInteractions(canvas)` now binds the same hover, pins, figure selection, legend drag/resize and pointer behavior to every stable surface.
- Data / Analysis / Field preserve per-surface 2D view state, pinned points and active-series identity when switching workspaces.
- The controller intentionally does **not** use fixed/absolute overlay portals.

### Field cleanup
- Removed the final 2D `appendChild(chart)` path.
- Removed `fwRestoreCompanionNodes()`.
- Removed dead `fwRemember()`, `fwRestore()` and `fwMove()` origin/reparenting helpers.
- `fw2DHost` now receives a Field-owned plot surface once and keeps it permanently.

### Runtime proof
The packaged smoke now performs an actual workspace cycle:
1. starts in Field and verifies the canonical canvas belongs to Field;
2. enters Data and selects Data Catalog;
3. enters Analysis and verifies the canonical canvas belongs to Analysis;
4. returns to Data and verifies Data Catalog state is restored;
5. returns to Field and verifies the canonical canvas belongs to Field again;
6. verifies Data / Analysis / Field parent elements are unchanged throughout.

### Regression prevention
- Added `desktop/tests/plot-surfaces.test.cjs`.
- CI now fails if:
  - the Field workspace reintroduces chart reparenting/restoration;
  - stable Data / Analysis / Field surfaces disappear;
  - canvas interactions stop being reusable;
  - the controller introduces an overlay portal;
  - surface state preservation is removed;
  - packaged runtime surface cycling is no longer asserted.
- CI manifest now contains **58** test files, each executed exactly once.

### Validation evidence
- Real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Independent B13 VTK streamline validation: **SUCCESS**.
- Stable 2D Plot Surface regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Section ownership / anti-leak regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Persistent Field Workspace UX regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Analysis UI organization regression: **SUCCESS**.
- Full 58-test manifest: **SUCCESS**.
- Portable Windows executable + Data/Analysis/Field surface-cycle smoke: **SUCCESS**.
- Installer build + installed-application surface-cycle smoke: **SUCCESS**.

### Architecture status
- The previous UX-07 / UX-12 singleton-chart compatibility boundary is **closed**.
- There is no remaining intentional chart reparenting bridge between Data, Analysis and Field.

## 2026-10-06 — GitHub Copilot agent delegation

Added repository-level Copilot instructions and custom App Maintainer, QA Regression and Release Manager agents. The contracts make scientific provenance, workspace ownership, 3D/Profile/Time-Series/Solver-Log separation, current-commit regression evidence, Windows build/smoke validation and updater integrity mandatory agent constraints.

Purpose: move bounded implementation, regression inspection and release preparation to repository agents while keeping cross-project ChatGPT focused on architecture and coordination.

No FoamLens scientific behavior, UI behavior, version or release artifact changed in this infrastructure-only update.

## 2026-10-06 — ChatGPT-ready task intake

Added `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/chatgpt-task.yml` so new implementation/audit tasks can capture the desired outcome, evidence, scope, acceptance criteria, required validation and release permission up front.

Purpose: reduce repeated context reconstruction in future ChatGPT sessions and make repository work resumable from a bounded GitHub Issue without changing product behavior.

## 2026-10-06 — Deterministic real-case packaged smoke selection

**Finding:** Windows build run `37434467481` passed the scientific/unit suite and packaged executable launch, but the real OpenFOAM packaged smoke failed after switching to `B13_prghPressure_airGapOF14`: the requested `metal / T / t=9.8` selection ended on `CoCell`.

**Evidence:** the QuickCup/VTK regression in the same workflow confirmed `T` exists in the `metal` region. The smoke helper used `dispatchEvent('change')` for an async case-change handler and only polled for the case ID/name; that condition could become true before `fvHandleCaseChange()` finished its awaited frame load. The still-running case load could then overwrite the smoke's requested field.

**Action:** the smoke-only helper now invokes and awaits `fvHandleCaseChange()` directly before applying region/field/time selection. Requested regions/fields now also fail immediately with an explicit list of available choices instead of silently retaining a default field.

**Scope:** smoke-test synchronization only; normal FoamLens user interaction and scientific field-selection behavior are unchanged.

**Validation status:** replacement `fix/deterministic-real-case-smoke` Windows CI is required before closing the finding.

### Follow-up validation correction

Replacement run `37437700568` reached the regression suite but stopped at `native-performance.test.cjs` because that source-level guard still required the obsolete polling implementation token `while(performance.now()-started<30000)`. This was test drift caused by the synchronization fix, not a product failure.

The guard now requires the new deterministic contract (`await fvHandleCaseChange()`) plus explicit unavailable-region/field diagnostics. A fresh Windows CI run is required.

### Validation complete

Replacement Windows CI run `37438147013` completed **SUCCESS** on commit `ed113c9637af9e0d98514eec77b775cd290f18e4`.

Validated in the successful run:
- real QuickCup/OpenFOAM regression;
- full frontend/scientific regression suite;
- native-performance guard updated for the awaited case-switch contract;
- portable Windows publish;
- packaged executable real-case smoke, including requested `metal / T / t=9.8`;
- installer build;
- installed-application smoke test.

Conclusion: the prior `CoCell` result was a smoke synchronization race, not missing `T` data. The deterministic smoke fix is validated and ready to merge. Merging is intentionally kept separate because a `main` desktop change invokes the repository's current main-branch release workflow.

### Release publication guard

During P0 reconciliation, the FoamLens workflow was found to publish a GitHub Release automatically for every qualifying `main` desktop push. That conflicts with the repository agent/release contract requiring explicit publication authorization and makes safe maintenance merges capable of producing unintended releases.

The workflow now keeps full CI/build/portable/installer validation on `main`, but `Publish GitHub Release` runs only for:
- an explicit `v*` tag; or
- manual `workflow_dispatch` with `publish=true`.

`auto-update.test.cjs` now guards this separation so future CI changes cannot silently restore implicit main-branch publication.

### Final branch validation after release-policy guard

Windows CI run `37439205812` completed **SUCCESS** on functional/workflow commit `47c9d75eb6e9866cff0dd14abef51092c17a072b`.

The successful run validates the combined change set:
- deterministic awaited real-case smoke switching;
- updated source-level smoke regression guard;
- full QuickCup/OpenFOAM and scientific/UI regression suite;
- portable packaged real-case smoke;
- installer build and installed-app smoke;
- explicit release-publication policy regression, with ordinary `main` pushes no longer sufficient to publish a GitHub Release.

The only later branch changes are documentation entries recording this evidence.

## 2026-10-06 — Official FoamLens identity adopted across active product surfaces

**Source of truth:** `realmichelduarte/Michel-Software-Standards/shared-assets/product-logos/foamlens` (approved concept: 3D field/focus surface).

**Migration:**
- vendored the canonical `official-app-icon.svg`, `official-mark.svg` and `official-lockup.svg` under `desktop/src/FoamLensDesktop/frontend/assets/branding`;
- replaced the legacy inline launch/sidebar/About marks and data-URI favicon with the canonical assets;
- replaced `Assets/FoamLens.ico` with a seven-size (16/24/32/48/64/128/256) Windows derivative of the approved app icon, preserving the existing EXE/taskbar/shortcut/installer wiring;
- embedded the canonical SVGs in the .NET assembly and materialized them into the local WebView app directory so packaged FoamLens remains self-contained;
- updated the bundle workflow to vendor the assets and added `official-branding.test.cjs` plus stronger ICO-size validation;
- extended the packaged smoke to require successful rendering of launch, sidebar and About official assets and to reject the former competing inline mark.

**Scope:** product identity only. Scientific analysis, OpenFOAM parsing, workspace behavior and release version are unchanged.

**Validation required:** Windows CI must pass the complete regression/build/portable/installer smoke path before Issue #14 is closed.

### Branding branch validation complete

Windows CI run `37442846439` completed **SUCCESS** on functional head `fbf5e38c1ffe1dcee8ed42b38c46682778a0cec6`.

Validated in the successful run:
- real QuickCup/OpenFOAM regression;
- complete scientific/UI regression suite;
- canonical FoamLens SVG blob identity;
- official Windows multi-resolution ICO packaging;
- portable EXE build and packaged smoke with launch/sidebar/About brand rendering;
- installer build and installed-application smoke;
- GitHub Release publication correctly skipped on the branding branch.

The branch is ready to merge without a version bump or release publication.

### Main-branch branding validation complete

Merged PR #18 as `1b8213af89a2539e7da77cd532e389f001831c89`.

Main-branch Windows CI run `37443720415` completed **SUCCESS** and independently revalidated:
- canonical FoamLens SVG identity and local packaging;
- official multi-resolution Windows icon;
- complete scientific/UI regression suite;
- portable executable smoke;
- installer build and installed-app smoke.

`Publish GitHub Release` was **skipped**, confirming that the branding migration did not publish a new FoamLens version.

**Status:** official FoamLens logo adoption is complete across the active Windows/startup/About/in-app surfaces covered by Issue #14.
## 2026-10-06 — Chat-driven release publication enabled

- Release workflow policy changed so a push to `main` whose head commit message starts with `release:` publishes the validated GitHub Release automatically after all CI gates pass.
- Ordinary `main` pushes remain validation-only and do not publish releases.
- Manual `workflow_dispatch publish=true` and tag-triggered publication remain supported as fallback paths, but are no longer required for releases initiated from ChatGPT/GitHub tooling.
- Updated release-policy regressions in `version-consistency.test.cjs` and `auto-update.test.cjs` to enforce the new explicit `release:` intent gate.
- Validation: workflow run #853 passed QuickCup/OpenFOAM + VTK, full desktop regression suite, portable Windows smoke, installed-app smoke, checksums, artifact upload, and `Publish GitHub Release`.
- Published public release: `FoamLens v1.6.0` with portable EXE, installer EXE, and both SHA-256 checksum assets.
- State: COMPLETE. Future FoamLens releases can be initiated directly from chat by committing an explicit `release:` change to `main`; no manual tag creation or Actions UI step is required.



## 2026-10-06 — v1.6.1 Field command-surface continuation

**Branch:** `development/v1.6.1-field-command-surface`.

### Findings
- Field's contextual controls already had correct permanent ownership, but were rendered as a fixed floating Inspector instead of using the application's sidebar.
- The canonical frame-cache selector (`256 MB / 512 MB / 1 GB / 2 GB`) remained buried inside 3D controls while the canonical physical-time transport had already moved to the Ribbon.
- The Field Ribbon still allowed horizontal overflow despite the command surface containing enough groups to require wrapping.
- Field view/layout transitions could request both the 3D renderer and 2D plot renderer even when only one surface was visible.

### Actions
- Reused the existing canonical Field control trees and moved `fwControlsDrawer` into the real application sidebar; no mirror selectors were introduced.
- The sidebar remains contextual: 3D/Split shows 3D controls, while Spatial Profile / Time Series / Solver Logs show their existing owned 2D controls.
- Kept `fvCase / fvRegion / fvField / fvComponent` as the authoritative selectors inside the Field sidebar.
- Moved the existing `fvCacheLimit` and `fvCacheReadout` beside the existing `fwTimeTransport` in the Field Ribbon.
- Moved the existing Split companion chooser into the Ribbon and hid the now-redundant internal Field workspace bar while the Ribbon is active.
- Field Ribbon groups now wrap instead of requiring horizontal scrolling.
- Added requestAnimationFrame render coalescing so hidden 2D/3D surfaces are not redrawn simply because the layout changed.
- Removed a second multi-view render cascade: `fcUpdateLayout()` previously called the primary `fvRender()` and then rendered View B / difference / Views C-D again even though the patched primary renderer already cascades to those views.
- Verified Views C and D retain independent `Case / Region / Field / Component` selectors and added an explicit regression contract for them.

### Regression contract
Updated Field workspace, Ribbon, Field View and final UX audit tests to require the contextual sidebar, canonical cache placement, wrapped Ribbon command surface and render coalescing.

### Validation status
Branch CI is required on the final head before promotion to `main`. No release publication is authorized by this entry.

### 2026-10-06 Windows packaged-smoke follow-up
- Branch workflow run `37529035320` passed the scientific/UI regression suite and portable publish step, then failed specifically in `Smoke-test packaged FoamLens executable`.
- The packaged runtime evidence showed the app, Ribbon, 3D runtime and WebView2 video smoke all started successfully. The failing assertion was `highResRerendered=false` during the 1800×1200 primary 3D export smoke.
- Root cause: `fcUpdateLayout()` could leave a coalesced `requestAnimationFrame` pending. If high-resolution export started before that frame executed, the deferred normal-layout render could resize the primary canvas back to viewport dimensions before the export capture verified the requested pixel size.
- Fix: multi-view layout rendering now preserves the unpatched primary renderer as `fvRender.__fcBase`, renders the primary and comparison views exactly once per coalesced layout pass, and exposes `fcFlushLayoutRender()` to cancel/flush a pending layout render. Multi-panel export flushes that work before explicit high-resolution rendering.
- Regression coverage now requires the flush/cancel path and the high-resolution export integration. The intentionally independent visual-settings smoke state (`fcSyncVisuals=false`) was confirmed not to be a failure criterion.
- Replacement Windows CI on the final branch head remains required before merge/release promotion.


### 2026-10-06 — v1.6.1 About / identity reconciliation
- Replaced the legacy embedded About portrait with the canonical 2026-10-06 Michel Duarte portrait from `Michel-Software-Standards` (blob `be4d18572bec28d53783cd4db05cb6cd289a7916`) and vendored it locally so packaged FoamLens remains self-contained.
- Added the official Michel's Lab parent-brand lockup from the canonical master asset (blob `7819ef5c7d1a5c338c67c9bbd517e5448724a5cf`) inside the author/studio block, preserving the required Product → Author → Michel's Lab → Social hierarchy.
- Kept the existing social controls but reconciled their targets to the canonical URLs in `brand/developer-profile.json`.
- Removed stale About literals `FoamLens · v39` and `Desktop v1.3.2`; About now exposes frontend v51 plus the shared Desktop-version label.
- Removed the packaged-host dependency on the historical `1.4.9 → 1.6.0` HTML replacement. The Windows host now injects its assembly version as isolated `data-foamlens-desktop-version` state on the root element, while visible version labels keep using `data-desktop-version`; the standalone frontend uses the current public Desktop version as fallback.
- Field View's version dialog now reads the shared `flDesktopVersion()` helper instead of hard-coding `Desktop v1.6.0`.
- Extended branding/version regressions and packaged smoke to require the canonical portrait and Michel's Lab lockup to render successfully.
- Added `desktop/tests/findings-export.test.cjs` and wired it exactly once into Windows CI. The regression parses v22 and protects provenance fields, heavy-array exclusion, evidence-vs-inference guidance, Markdown/JSON exports, Copy for ChatGPT, GitHub issue handoff, and both Workspace/Review attachment points.
- Current-head Windows CI is required before this block is considered validated. No version bump or release publication is authorized by this entry.

## 2026-10-06 — Intelligent Michel's Lab brand-adoption guidance

Repository instructions now explicitly route logo, launcher, splash/startup and About work through the Michel-Software-Standards Product Identity Standard and Brand Adoption Playbook.

The required interpretation is structural integration rather than sticker placement: replace active legacy identity, adapt canonical geometry to the existing product design language, preserve unrelated behavior, validate the build, and keep release publication separate unless explicitly authorized.


### 2026-10-06 — Packaged launch-readiness smoke hardening
- Windows runs `37537064322` (#870) and `37537319500` (#872) both reached successful navigation and `document.readyState=complete`, then failed the immediate `document.body.innerText.includes('FoamLens')` assertion before any scientific/runtime smoke work.
- Source and bundle inspection confirmed that the launch surface, `#launchTitle`, app shell, closing body and inline JavaScript remained present and that the workflow rebuilt `AppBundle.zip` from the current frontend before publishing.
- **Superseded diagnosis:** the initial hypothesis blamed faster navigation after removing the embedded portrait. Later DOM evidence disproved that: the smoke was correctly observing a document whose root content had been replaced.
- The packaged smoke now waits up to 10 seconds for the actual `#launchTitle` to contain `FoamLens`, be displayed/visible, and have non-zero rendered dimensions. Failure retains diagnostic evidence for title text/display/visibility/size, body display/visibility/classes/text length, ready state and URL.
- This is a stronger visual-readiness gate than the former one-shot body-text assertion; it does not accept a hidden or zero-size launch surface.
- `desktop/tests/official-branding.test.cjs` protects both the bounded wait and its blank-screen diagnostics. Replacement current-head Windows CI remains required.


### 2026-10-06 — Root cause of packaged blank document
- Runs #870–#891 progressively proved the bundle, materialized `index.html`, requested navigation and HTTP response were all present. Run #891 finally captured `document.documentElement.outerHTML` as `<html lang="en" data-desktop-version="1.6.0">Desktop v1.6.0</html>`.
- Root cause: the v1.6.1 version cleanup stored assembly version on the root `<html>` element using the same `data-desktop-version` attribute used by visible labels. `flSyncVersionLabels()` intentionally updates every `[data-desktop-version]` element via `textContent`; because the root element matched, it erased the complete `<head>` and `<body>`.
- Fix: runtime version state now uses the isolated `data-foamlens-desktop-version` key and `flDesktopVersion()` reads `document.documentElement.dataset.foamLensDesktopVersion`. Visible launch/sidebar/footer/About labels retain `data-desktop-version`.
- Removed the temporary `WebResourceRequested` local-origin serving experiments and restored the previously validated `SetVirtualHostNameToFolderMapping` architecture. The stronger smoke diagnostics, NavigationId binding, materialized-frontend validation and AppBundle integrity gate remain.
- Added regression assertions that forbid `data-desktop-version` on the root `<html>` element and require the isolated runtime-version key. Current-head Windows CI is required before promotion.


### 2026-10-06 — Packaged branding readiness follow-up
- Windows run #896 confirmed the blank-document root cause was fixed: `#launchTitle` rendered visibly, the full DOM remained present, and the document title reported `FoamLens v51 · Desktop v1.6.0 — by Michel Duarte`.
- The next smoke failure moved forward to the official-branding gate. The previous gate checked five images immediately after launch and could fail before hidden About assets completed image decode.
- The host now validates that the materialized official FoamLens lockup/mark plus canonical Michel Duarte portrait and Michel's Lab lockup exist and are non-empty before WebView initialization.
- Packaged branding smoke now waits up to 10 seconds for each required image to exist, be an `HTMLImageElement`, complete decoding, and report non-zero natural dimensions; failures preserve per-image `src`, `complete`, `naturalWidth`, and `naturalHeight`.
- Current-head Windows CI remains required before merge/release promotion.


### 2026-10-07 — immutable portrait and restored parent-brand authority
- Master authority changed after the earlier v1.6.1 About work. The exact user-provided canonical Michel Duarte portrait is now `shared-assets/michel_duarte_avatar.jpg`, Git blob `18fe1a68722850c3d8f918dc0799f46ffeb6dbaf`, 1440×1920, and is immutable. Interim portrait blobs `be4d1857…` and `9454e22e…` are rejected.
- Michel's Lab restored the physical production lockup source. FoamLens now vendors `shared-assets/michels-lab/official-lockup.png` byte-for-byte as `assets/branding/michels-lab/official-lockup.png`, Git blob `7fd48093968b31ddacd3098f5b15d962de580652`, 2172×724.
- Removed the temporary/local repaired lockup derivative and all runtime data-URI/base64 rewriting of About raster assets. Presentation sizing/cropping remains render-time only.
- Removed the Windows CI raster re-export/recompression diagnostic because it violated the immutable portrait contract.
- Synced the managed Michel's Lab child-agent contract to `2026-10-06.3`.
- About retains Product → Author → Michel's Lab → Social ordering and now exposes the QA-recognized parent-brand path.
- Current-head Windows CI remains required before this work can be marked verified. No release publication is authorized by this entry.
### 2026-10-07 — v1.6.1 current-head branding gate and Windows validation
- Windows run #909 (commit `340341a9b791158a10be8800163e49aa5d568b30`) passed the real OpenFOAM / VTK job and reached the Desktop regression suite, then failed only at `desktop/tests/official-branding.test.cjs` with `Materialized frontend validation does not require michels-lab/official-lockup.png`.
- The product host was already correct: `Program.cs` requires the canonical parent-brand asset through `Path.Combine("assets", "branding", "michels-lab", "official-lockup.png")`. The regression test incorrectly required the slash-separated path to appear as one literal source string, producing a false negative.
- Commit `51f5517a9852327164929cc209cb580211c31791` changes only the branding regression contract so it accepts either a literal asset path or the equivalent C# `Path.Combine` expression. About layout, canonical portrait bytes, Michel's Lab lockup bytes and runtime asset handling were not changed.
- Windows run #910 on `51f5517a9852327164929cc209cb580211c31791` completed successfully. Evidence includes real QuickCup integration, independent VTK streamline validation, Windows-safe multi-case 3D fixture generation, embedded bundle integrity, official branding, Field View / strict 3D difference coverage, Findings handoff, multi-panel performance/export, persistent Field Workspace and cross-session state, Ribbon/anti-leak/final UX gates, portable executable smoke, SHA-256 generation, installer build, installer SHA-256 generation, and actual install + installed-app smoke.
- Optional Authenticode steps were skipped because no signing certificate is configured. GitHub Release publication was also skipped, as intended for an unpromoted development branch.
- The older `development/v1.6.1-ui-polish` branch was reviewed before promotion. Its two unique commits only move the canonical frame-cache selector beside playback and guard that placement; the active v1.6.1 branch already contains a stronger implementation that moves the real cache selector plus cache readout beside the shared playback transport, wraps the Field Ribbon and prevents horizontal Ribbon scrolling. No redundant cherry-pick is required.
- No version bump, merge, tag or release publication is authorized by this entry.
### 2026-10-06 — FoamLens Desktop v1.6.1 stable release
- User explicitly authorized the stable v1.6.1 promotion.
- Release-preparation commit `f41fc44c76ffdfd2bc03e33754070cfdc85adf0c` bumped Desktop, assembly/file, frontend fallback, installer fallback, README and release-contract expectations to v1.6.1 and dated the v1.6.1 changelog.
- Candidate Windows CI run #911 (`37558931918`) completed successfully at the exact v1.6.1 candidate head, including QuickCup/VTK, the complete scientific/UI regression suite, portable smoke, installer build, checksums, actual installation and installed-app smoke.
- PR #19 merged to `main` as release commit `45d18c43b845fafb45c9497aaa011d92c64d5b8c`.
- Main release run #912 (`37559553035`) completed successfully and passed the `Publish GitHub Release` gate after re-running the full validation suite on the merged tree.
- GitHub Release `v1.6.1` is stable (`draft=false`, `prerelease=false`) and is the repository's latest release.
- Published assets: `FoamLens-Portable-v1.6.1.exe`, `FoamLens-Portable-v1.6.1.exe.sha256`, `FoamLens-Setup-v1.6.1.exe`, and `FoamLens-Setup-v1.6.1.exe.sha256`.
- Optional Authenticode signing remains unavailable because no Windows publisher certificate is configured; this does not affect the completed checksum, packaging, install or runtime smoke gates.

### 2026-10-06 — Microsoft Store MSIX channel started from live Partner Center identity
- The user created/reserved the live FoamLens Microsoft Store product and supplied the actual Product Identity values from Partner Center.
- Canonical Store identity is `MichelDuarte.FoamLens` / `CN=D2024BFC-8238-4063-A8DD-A91208327224` / publisher display name `Michel Duarte`, Store ID `9P0PTHSQ89LL`.
- Added a separate `distribution/microsoft-store-msix` implementation path modeled on the proven Michel's Life Store packaging pattern without changing the public FoamLens v1.6.1 direct-release channel.
- The Store build uses a compile-time `FOAMLENS_STORE` channel: automatic GitHub release checks are skipped, the GitHub update Ribbon action is not mounted, and a manual bridge call is guarded with a Microsoft Store update message.
- Added a Partner Center identity source, MSIX manifest template, Store assets generator, manifest renderer, Store source smoke checks, a dedicated Store MSIX workflow, and the Store contract regression in the normal Desktop suite.
- The dedicated Store workflow builds the same self-contained FoamLens Desktop code, smoke-tests the Store executable before packaging, creates/unpacks/verifies the x64 MSIX, validates the live Partner Center identity, creates SHA-256 evidence, and uploads the unsigned MSIX only as a CI artifact.
- Store signing/certification/publication are intentionally not claimed here; Microsoft Store provider evidence remains pending until Partner Center accepts the package.
- Windows CI #913 reached the new Store contract after all preceding version/updater/scientific checks passed, then exposed a portability defect in the new test: it matched one exact LF + indentation sequence. The implementation itself was correct and the dedicated Store workflow had already compiled/smoke-tested/packed it successfully. The contract was hardened to a whitespace/CRLF-tolerant regex; no Store runtime behavior changed.
- CI #914 exposed that the CRLF-tolerant test fix itself contained a literal `\\n` token outside a JavaScript string, causing a syntax error before the assertion could run. The test source was corrected to contain a real newline and both Store validation paths now run `node --check desktop/tests/store-msix.test.cjs` before executing the contract. No product/runtime/MSIX behavior changed.
- Full Windows CI #915 passed the Store contract, all scientific/UI regressions and portable smoke, then exposed a real direct-installer packaging regression: the second MSBuild PropertyGroup made the PowerShell XML version read produce a trailing-space value. Inno Setup created `FoamLens-Setup-v1.6.1.exe`, while Copy-Item searched for `FoamLens-Setup-v1.6.1 .exe`. The Store constant is now conditional inside the existing primary PropertyGroup and both direct/Store version resolvers trim the XML value. Product version remains 1.6.1.

### 2026-10-07 — Post-v1.6.1 hardening from master multi-channel audit
- Removed the stale DesktopVersion fallback `1.6.0`; missing assembly version metadata now fails explicitly instead of silently impersonating an older release.
- Replaced two v1.6.0 runtime-smoke diagnostic labels with `DesktopVersionText` and removed the stale versioned Field View source header.
- Extended `version-consistency.test.cjs` to reject any real semantic-version literal used as a null-coalescing runtime fallback.
- Microsoft Store MSIX workflow now validates pushes to `main` as well as `distribution/**`, preventing future shared-source changes from bypassing the Store channel.
- No release/tag/publication action is part of this hardening change.
- CI #918 exposed one remaining test-only version pin: `native-performance.test.cjs` still required the historical literal `FoamLens v1.6.0 3D runtime UI smoke passed`. The product implementation had correctly moved to `DesktopVersionText`; the regression assertion was updated to protect the version-derived behavior rather than a historical release string.


## 2026-10-07 — Repository transferred to Michel's Lab organization

**Change:** GitHub ownership moved from `realmichelduarte/FoamLens` to `michels-lab/FoamLens`.

**Active references updated:**
- `.michelslab/project.yml` now identifies `michels-lab/FoamLens` and `michels-lab/Michel-Software-Standards` as the current project and shared authority.
- `MICHELS_LAB_PROJECT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` now point to the organization-owned standards repository.
- Desktop updater release discovery and fallback release URLs now target `michels-lab/FoamLens` directly instead of relying on GitHub's old-owner redirect.
- Updater contract test updated to the canonical organization endpoint.

**Preserved intentionally:** personal developer/social links remain under `realmichelduarte`; the QuickCup research fixture remains `realmichelduarte/QuickCup-Solidification`.

**Validation state:** repository transfer and admin/push access verified. Branch CI/build validation is required before merge; historical log references are preserved as historical evidence.

### 2026-10-07 — Field Mapping physical-dimension guard (pending CI)
- Audit found that `fmSuggestMappingsWithMetadata` could select a name-matched field despite conflicting explicit SI dimensions, incorrectly attributing physical meaning to the data.
- Known-dimension roles (temperature, velocity, density, vorticity, thermal/density gradients) now reject contradictory metadata before scoring candidates. If metadata is absent, name-based suggestions remain available.
- Added regressions for swapped names, rejected incompatible mapping, and missing-dimension fallback.
- Scientific comparison and UI ownership are intentionally unchanged. Validation: PR CI pending; no release or `main` promotion authorized.

### 2026-10-08 — Candidate closure v1.6.2 (release validation required)
- Combined post-v1.6.1 Field Mapping dimension safety with corrected About iconography and canonical Michel's Lab slogan, keeping immutable identity assets unchanged.
- Synchronized C# Desktop, installer, frontend fallback, README and version-contract test to candidate 1.6.2.
- Windows CI #923–#926 passed for intermediate source commits. The new candidate commit, final merge, direct install and Store MSIX remain unverified until current-SHA CI completes.
- No claim of Store certification, signing or release publication before actual evidence.

### 2026-10-08 — Temporal comparison dimensional guard (pending final candidate CI)
- Audited dimensional comparison paths: strict 3D delta already refuses differing field/component/association/dimensions; temporal 2D quantitative comparison did not.
- Candidate now refuses A−B, RMSE, percent, export and derived-curve generation when source SI dimensions or explicit units contradict. Native alignment remains allowed for independent-series visualization.
- Added regression coverage for incompatible temperature/pressure dimensions, same-dimension differently scaled/displayed units, absent metadata, and gate wiring.
- Missing metadata remains explicitly not proof of compatibility; do not manufacture dimensions. Final Windows and Store validation still required before release.

### 2026-10-08 — FoamLens launch visual-regression incident and cross-app prevention
- User screenshot of stable v1.6.2 revealed visually incorrect startup identity despite green packaged CI. Root causes: competing `.launchMark` rules including an older `248px!important` forced a tiny lockup, canonical lockup SVG contains dark wordmark text on a dark surface, and a second oversized `FoamLens` h1 duplicated the product name.
- Candidate branch `fix/launch-brand-visual-gate` replaces startup lockup with canonical mark + one readable semantic h1 and themed, contour-derived hero layout; does not modify canonical SVG/portrait/logo bytes or analysis logic.
- Added actual WebView2 rendered dark/light contrast, mark size and hierarchy checks; portable and installed launcher screenshots are now mandatory CI artifacts for **human review**, not automatically treated as visually approved.
- Main `michels-lab/Michel-Software-Standards` has versioned cross-app rendered-brand acceptance rules and QA/Agent/Release Governor gates; child agent contract is synchronized on the FoamLens fix branch.
- Current stable v1.6.2 is unchanged; no new release is authorized. Validation/evidence of candidate screenshot review remains pending until CI completes and output is inspected.

### 2026-10-08 — Brand/visual release gate hardening after v1.6.2
- Found a live localized About regression: `syncLanguage()` overwrote the canonical `TOOLS WITH IDENTITY.` with the obsolete studio slogan in EN and ES. Fixed both dictionaries and replaced the dark-text product lockup on About with the untouched canonical mark, visibly preserved in compact layouts.
- Added actual packaged WebView2 Home/About screenshot and measured identity checks at wide + compact viewport emulations, including canonical portrait/studio, readable social network names/icons, scrolling and Close.
- Vendored the master's fail-closed UI evidence validator and added immutable screenshot manifests bound to the exact source SHA and installer/MSIX artifact SHA-256. The Store visual capture is from the running unpacked Store executable and does **not** establish installed/signed Store-package verification.
- Removed direct GitHub Release publication from Windows `build` and moved it behind a separate `publish` job using `visual-release-approval`; this job refuses to publish without an independent real GitHub environment approval record and same-SHA/installer screenshot evidence. Configuring at least one human required reviewer for that GitHub Environment is an external prerequisite. Until configured, automatic publication is intentionally blocked.
- No new release was authorized; latest stable stays v1.6.2. Preserve the canonical product mark and Michel's Lab asset bytes.

### 2026-10-08 — Unified FoamLens UX redesign (candidate, visual QA pending)
- Root issue: accepted brand SVG files were placed into unrelated, oversized launch/About/sidebar cards while Data/3D/Analysis owned inconsistent toolbar, state and panel semantics. User requested a single product-native UI based on FoamLens's layered field geometry and retained usability under panel collapse.
- Consolidated compact About product→author+studio→contacts composition, with five social icons/names above fold at normal desktop sizes and real WebView2 bounds gate, preserving official portraits/logos byte-for-byte.
- Added fixed application identity/name and permanent About/Updates global actions; legacy collapsible sidebar branding is hidden when Ribbon shell is active; Store-channel Updates explains Microsoft Store ownership.
- Field ribbon now uses compact primary command row and one-at-a-time Inspect/Compare/Camera subbars, with optional cache controls; all 3D navigation buttons moved to a docked toolbar outside scientific viewport; camera directions collapsed.
- Data hides 3D case comparison sidebar settings; default startup uses single Field 3D view, explicit imported Workspace compare remains opt-in; Compare 3D reveals view-B inspector controls.
- Native OpenFOAM large-field progress now owns a push/pop lifecycle, displays non-fabricated stalled/waiting feedback and clears its timer and toast in finally.
- Added static regression guards, but runtime screenshots of actual Windows Data/Field/Analysis/regular About still require inspection and acceptance. This is not a new release and does not change canonical assets.

## 2026-10-08 — PR #32 integration on current main (candidate, not a release)

- Rebased the cohesive Field/Data design changes from `design/foamlens-cohesive-ui-20261008` onto main `ef400dcee2c221a807f889b32b17dcf1da5c9524` by constructing a two-parent reconciliation commit.
- Retained the newer About changes from PR #34 (paired product/studio design, five named socials visible in the initial viewport) instead of restoring superseded About CSS/markup.
- Moved About/Updates to persistent chrome, added a one-at-a-time 3D contextual ribbon, default single 3D viewport, Data sidebar scoping, OpenFOAM load feedback and global design tokens.
- Corrected the packaged Windows runtime smoke to expect persistent `flGlobalUpdates` instead of deleted `flRaCheckUpdates`. Earlier failed Windows #37749410491 due solely to `missingActions:["flRaCheckUpdates"]` in its runtime Ribbon assertion; the real OpenFOAM fixture passed.
- Preserved PR #33 policy: automated visual evidence and artifact integrity remain mandatory; owner visual review occurs after publication, not as a manual pre-release blocking gate.
- Same-SHA Windows and Store CI are **pending** for the resulting integration commit. Do not declare a new release from this log entry.

## 2026-10-08 — Authorized FoamLens Desktop v1.7.0 release

- User explicitly requested `dale release` after FoamLens PR #32 was merged into `main` at `b7def31cffbe3044e6663ae5964c11bd9661d343`.
- Exact-HEAD Windows CI #37757447075 and Microsoft Store MSIX CI #37757447024 were both SUCCESS before the release version bump.
- Prepared Desktop, installer, frontend fallback, README and version-contract tests for v1.7.0; v51 remains the embedded frontend version.
- Reconciled a stale GitHub release `publish` job that still required a pre-release human approval although the owner explicitly chooses to inspect rendered visuals after release. Kept automated runtime screenshot, checksum, provenance and exact-artifact release gates mandatory.
- Release authorization triggers a `release:` commit on main and full same-SHA Windows / QuickCup / Store workflows. **At commit time, publication is pending current release SHA checks, not yet verified.**
- No assertion of signed binaries, Microsoft Store certification or Partner Center publication.

### 2026-10-08 — v1.7.0 publication verified (post-release audit)

- Authorized release commit: `2f8ec4af09e679af889f6b5d8ca4936a9ae519bc` (`release: FoamLens Desktop v1.7.0`).
- Exact release-SHA Windows Actions run `37807950228` completed **SUCCESS**: real QuickCup regression, frontend/scientific tests, portable execution, installer installation/launch, and exact-artifact Home/About screenshot integrity validation. Separate `publish` job completed **SUCCESS**.
- Exact release-SHA Microsoft Store MSIX Actions run `37807949937` completed **SUCCESS**; artifact `FoamLens-Store-v1.7.0` produced. Store acceptance/Partner Center publication remains **not verified**; package is unsigned for Store submission and is not a direct-download installer.
- GitHub stable release `v1.7.0` published at `2026-10-08T16:27:17Z`: https://github.com/michels-lab/FoamLens/releases/tag/v1.7.0 . Assets: `FoamLens-Portable-v1.7.0.exe` + `.sha256` and `FoamLens-Setup-v1.7.0.exe` + `.sha256`.
- Owner's visual review is post-release; CI screenshot-based gating remained mandatory. No Authenticode signature or Microsoft Store certification is implied.

## 2026-10-08 — Next-version FoamLens visual regression candidate (not released)

- User screenshots from v1.7.0 show a small launch logo, unapproved circular arcs/ticks in the purported canonical mark, uncentered launch composition, stacked/crowded Field Ribbon, hidden camera direction presets, two 3D viewports perceived as default, and inaccessible per-view case selectors in the sidebar.
- Master Michel's Lab draft PR #28 removes rejected arcs/ticks from three FoamLens SVGs; the wave/field concept remains. **Not approved or merged to master.** The Windows ICO derivative still needs regeneration and visual validation before any next release.
- FoamLens branch `design/foamlens-next-centered-launch-20261008` contains a candidate: large centered launch mark, centered content, arc-free brand source SVGs, compact single-row Field Ribbon, exclusive Inspect/Compare/Camera subbars, visible Front/Back/Left/Right/Top/Bottom/Isometric commands, and reparented orbit/pan/zoom tools so the canvas is not covered by a second toolbar.
- Field inspector exposes Case/Region choices for View A and optionally View B at the top; B remains hidden until explicit Compare. 3D comparison must not open on first Field entry due to implicit saved flags; scientific comparison and user's deliberate multi-view control remain available.
- Static visual checks and native geometry checks strengthened. **Candidate validation pending exact-head Windows / Store CI, owner review and Windows icon update.** Keep v1.7.0 unchanged; no new public release authorized.

### 2026-10-08 — Next UI candidate: exact-code CI verification

- Source candidate commit `c6489d741987d457b38d47b6bca4ce6397f1d63f` in draft FoamLens PR #35 passed the Windows CI run [#37813484567](https://github.com/michels-lab/FoamLens/actions/runs/37813484567): real QuickCup/VTK, scientific and JavaScript regression tests, packaged portable runtime smoke, actual Windows installation/runtime smoke, native Home/About screenshot evidence and artifact validation. The publication job correctly skipped because this is a design branch, not an authorized release.
- Same source candidate commit passed unsigned Microsoft Store MSIX build/smoke/evidence in CI [#37813484605](https://github.com/michels-lab/FoamLens/actions/runs/37813484605). Neither Microsoft Store publication nor signing is implied.
- Runtime visual checks measured a single-line Field Ribbon at 50px high with no primary-row overflow, mutually exclusive Inspect/Compare/Camera subbars, visible front/isometric camera presets, independent sidebar case/region selectors per view, a single 3D view by default, and the secondary canvas/selector hidden when comparison is off. Centered splash/launch dimensions and dark/light text contrast were validated with native WebView2.
- Earlier candidate CI failures were investigated and fixed: a missing generated CSS-array comma prevented Ribbon mounting; native smoke initially accessed an unexposed lexical variable instead of the official comparison API; and one existing Field View regression asserted a fragile adjacent source string rather than render order.
- **Next-release blockers:** Windows ICO is a stale raster derivative still potentially showing the owner-rejected arcs and must be regenerated from the corrected design, and Michel's Lab canonical branding PR #28 remains draft pending owner visual feedback. PR #35 remains draft; do not merge or release without resolving these items and explicit release authorization.

### 2026-10-08 — Regenerate rejected Windows/Store icon from the canonical source

- Resolved the remaining derivative drift: `tools/generate_windows_icon.py` now rasterizes the arc-free `official-app-icon.svg` using pinned `resvg_py==0.5.0` into seven lossless PNG-encoded Windows ICO sizes (16,24,32,48,64,128,256). Generated icon has neither circular-orbit brackets nor cardinal tick marks.
- Windows and Store packaging CI regenerate the ICO **before** compiling and run `--check` to ensure exact source parity. `windows-icon.test.cjs` validates all seven embedded PNG frames, dimensions, offsets and installer/desktop icon wiring; obsolete opaque `>100 KB` size assumption removed.
- Added candidate-only `sync-foamlens-icon.yml` to commit the generated ICO binary back into the FoamLens branch, then dispatch exact-current-head Windows and MSIX validation after the binary commit; a release never triggers from this design branch.
- Master Michel's Lab branding PR #28 is still under integration at the time of writing. Actual icon-sync workflow results and fresh CI remain **pending** until GitHub completes them; do not claim signed executables, Store approval or a new release.

### 2026-10-08 — ICO sync orchestration correction

- Initial stand-alone `sync-foamlens-icon.yml` run #37815926542 ended in a no-job workflow failure, so it is not a proven synchronization path and is removed to prevent false-green branding claims.
- The existing, already functional Store MSIX workflow now regenerates and validates the arc-free Windows ICO with the packaged executable, then (on `design/**` only) commits that exact generated binary to its source branch and dispatches Windows/Store checks against the resulting commit.
- Both Windows/Store build workflows generate/verify the source-bound icon before their actual .NET packaging. This prevents both stale binaries and false claims of a corrected icon when the Git tree still includes the old one.
- The generated binary commit, successful subsequent CI and canonical master PR merger remain **to be verified**; do not publish a new release from the design branch.

## 2026-10-08 — Owner indefinitely pauses Microsoft Store builds

- **Owner instruction:** stop generating FoamLens Microsoft Store versions and spending GitHub Actions resources on MSIX packages for **all future FoamLens releases** until the owner explicitly authorizes a restart. This pause includes auto-CI, manual jobs, uploads, submission and certification. Direct Windows releases continue normally.
- Disabled `.github/workflows/build-store-msix.yml` on `main` in commit `d91b3a2df06b4d8f517c94e016727db91ffc2623`: removed push triggers, left `workflow_dispatch` for archival visibility and added an unconditionally false owner-resumption job guard, so no Store runner is allocated even if a person manually clicks Run Workflow.
- Disabled the same Store workflow on development PR #35 (`design/foamlens-next-centered-launch-20261008`) at commit `92d59464c621f4c4f18df8dbb581bf1026410af1`. Windows CI now owns on-demand icon synchronization and only dispatches the Windows workflow, never Store.
- Microsoft Store workflows that started **before** this explicit pause completed already; no active Store runs needed cancellation at the time of inspection. The last Store run for the arc-free ICO candidate was `37816516921`, successful on commit `8ff70d1`. This does not indicate Store submission or publication.
- Added a durable owner-specific pause exception to master Michel's Lab policies `standards/PRIVACY_AND_STORE_STANDARD.md` and `standards/CI_CD_STANDARD.md` in `Michel-Software-Standards` commits `bf6d826`/`22473ea`. No resumption date was requested; only a **new explicit user instruction** reactivates MSIX builds.

## 2026-10-08 — PR #35 branch/main integration

- Reconciled the GitHub main Store pause and project audit with design branch changes without replacing the newer Windows UX fixes or canonical arc-free app icon. MSIX workflow on merged branch is the paused main version, with no `push` trigger and an unconditionally false job gate. Owner explicitly authorized integrating changes and releasing Windows, **not** Microsoft Store.
- Windows icon source/master and on-disk ICO are synchronized; PR #35 latest pre-integration Windows CI #37816512451 and MSIX CI #37816516921 succeeded on icon-sync SHA `8ff70d1`. The next release requires *fresh* current-head Windows validation; no new Store CI is requested.

## 2026-10-08 — Authorized FoamLens Desktop v1.8.0 Windows release

- User explicitly authorized merging all PR #35 changes and publishing the next FoamLens release. PR #35 successfully merged into `main` in commit `dbd3a23b8071d248f2168a2b8ed8a10c5eba0cb8`.
- Bumped assembly, installer, README, fallback version and version-consistency contract to **1.8.0**, retaining frontend v51. Wrote user-visible release notes for the corrected brand, centered Home launch, compact Field Ribbon, camera presets and case-per-view selectors.
- Release is dispatched by a `release: FoamLens Desktop v1.8.0` commit on `main`; actual binary publication is **pending exact-release-SHA QuickCup, packaged portable/installed Windows and screenshot-to-artifact integrity gates at commit time**. Do not claim the public release exists until GitHub release API confirms tag/assets.
- Microsoft Store MSIX auto-build, manual job, upload, signing and submission remain indefinitely **PAUSED** by explicit owner instruction. No MSIX run is required or authorized as part of v1.8.0.

### 2026-10-08 — Corrected inactive Microsoft Store gate before v1.8.0 publication

- Release candidate commit `d3a94b3d6d51feb727a784885ff658c9990c733b` triggered exact-SHA Windows run [#37819274733](https://github.com/michels-lab/FoamLens/actions/runs/37819274733). Real QuickCup regression **SUCCESS** and Windows icon generation/compilation succeeded, but the build **FAILED** in `desktop/tests/windows-icon.test.cjs` because an old cross-channel assertion demanded an active icon parity step inside the now-paused Microsoft Store workflow; the publish job correctly skipped. No public v1.8.0 existed after this failure.
- Updated the test to require exact-source icon parity in active Windows CI and only require parity inside MSIX CI when that channel is active. Paused Store status is checked via absence of `push` and the explicit false owner-resumption job guard, avoiding any Store build or weakening native icon validation.
- A fresh `release:` commit retriggers v1.8.0 Windows tests and publication; **new exact-head release status pending** until GitHub release API proves tag/assets. Microsoft Store still paused.

## 2026-10-08 — FoamLens Desktop v1.8.0 published and verified

- Release commit and exact Git tag: `235e230405b489b39bace7172a4082bb594557bb` (`v1.8.0`). GitHub release API confirms **published**, non-draft, non-prerelease at 2026-10-08T17:59:14Z: https://github.com/michels-lab/FoamLens/releases/tag/v1.8.0.
- Exact release-SHA GitHub Actions [Windows run #37819926553](https://github.com/michels-lab/FoamLens/actions/runs/37819926553) completed **SUCCESS** in all three jobs: real OpenFOAM QuickCup regression; Windows build with native source-derived arc-free icon, frontend scientific and visual regression suite, packaged portable and installed executable smoke; and automated verified-artifact release publication.
- Published asset inventory verified via GitHub release API: `FoamLens-Portable-v1.8.0.exe` (73,656,455 bytes), `FoamLens-Portable-v1.8.0.exe.sha256`, `FoamLens-Setup-v1.8.0.exe` (68,447,199 bytes), `FoamLens-Setup-v1.8.0.exe.sha256`.
- Tag ref `refs/tags/v1.8.0` points to the **same exact** commit as CI head and verified `main` at publication. Public binaries contain the previously merged PR #35 centered/arc-free launch, compact Field Ribbon, camera presets and per-view case selectors.
- **Microsoft Store remains paused indefinitely**: no MSIX build was triggered by the v1.8.0 release commit, and no Partner Center upload/submission/certification is claimed. Windows signing credentials were unavailable/unused; release does not imply Authenticode signature.
- Owner visually reviews the downloaded v1.8.0 after publication; CI cannot guarantee subjective design acceptance beyond runtime screenshots and geometry checks. Any follow-up refinements belong to a later version, not a silent overwrite of v1.8.0 artifacts.

## 2026-10-08 — Root-cause fix: Data 2D vs Field 3D ownership (next version, unreleased)

- User screenshot of desktop v1.8.0 exposed `Synchronized 3D case comparison` inside `Data → Load Data` below catalog filters, burying the legitimate Data plot choices. Owner explicitly requires architecture correction, not CSS masking.
- Root cause: `fvInstallUi()` created `fieldViewControls` *after* Data `catalogControls` inside Load Data and appended `fieldViewPanel` directly into the Data chart viewport, hoping a later first Field visit would reparent them. The 3D compare extension then mounted under those misplaced controls.
- Replaced the cross-module ownership with a dedicated hidden `flFieldBootstrapHost` under `document.body` marked `foamlensOwner=field`; all Field 3D controls/canvas and extensions originate there, then move only to the Field workspace's `fw3DControlsHost` and `fw3DHost`. They never originate or return to Data.
- Established explicit Data-owned `flDataComparisonCard` / `flDataComparisonHost` for 2D curve differences; advanced Analysis retains its independent scientific modules. Moved `differenceTools` out of the Analysis owner instead of duplicating its controls, preserving source/event bindings.
- Restored primary Data Ribbon choices **Time series, Spatial profiles, Solver logs, Catalog** plus **Compare 2D**. Profile horizontal/vertical line, time selection, multiple-height comparison and log solver controls are preserved. Analysis 2D Δ entry points now navigate to the same Data-owned comparison card.
- Added regression tests for DOM origin/ownership, sidebar state and Data Ribbon navigation; native WebView2 smoke checks the entire Data → Field → Data lifecycle, including that no Field controls/canvas ever become descendants of Data's Load Data/chart containers.
- **Pending:** exact-head Windows scientific/portable/installed CI and real UI review. No new public release authorized. Microsoft Store remains indefinitely paused.

## 2026-10-08 — v1.8.0 field comparison metadata and full-width desktop shell regression

- Owner's v1.8.0 screenshot still shows the second 3D viewport's verbose case/field/path text **drawn over the WebGL canvas**, clashing with the in-canvas legend; two statistical readout cards force values and units into 4 miniature columns, truncating scientific values.
- Root cause: `v14-z-field-compare.js` appended `.fcViewLabel` directly to each `.fvViewport` and gave it `position:absolute` / `bottom:12px`; the shared seven-value `.fcStatsCells` grid used four fixed columns with `overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis`.
- Structural fix: `fcComposeViewport` consistently separates a stable `.fcViewportScene` (WebGL canvas, time badge, legend, probe) from a flow-layout `.fcViewportCaption` (case/field/path, diagnostics) for primary, second, difference and extra 3D views; scientific stats now use responsive two-column values that wrap and retain units; legend ticks use bounded 3-column layout.
- New complaint: opening/resizing the settings sidebar shrinks/reflows the Field ribbon and changes font sizes; isometric and directional presets are not discoverable. Root cause: top header and Ribbon belong to the `.main` sidebar-dependent track, all tabs/actions use assorted `7/8/9/10px` typography and preset commands are buried in the Camera subbar.
- Reorganized shared `v15-ribbon-ui.js`: full-viewport fixed header and Ribbon measured via `ResizeObserver`, sidebar and workspace both start below this immutable global chrome; compact single-row action surface with consistent 10px labels, always-visible Isometric/Front/Top/Right shortcuts and remaining camera directions in Camera context, without reducing label sizes when the sidebar opens.
- Also repaired the initial ownership regression that exposed 3D comparison and animation blocks in Data before opening Field: `fwInstall` now mounts both Field controls and its viewport into the Field-owned DOM immediately. Data gained actual Catalog/Profiles/Time Series/Solver Logs/Compare Ribbon actions, restoring access to existing data views.
- Added source and native WebView2 geometry checks for long labels, no overlay, 2-column statistics, global chrome width before/after toggling settings, sidebar starting under Ribbon, uniform action typography, and live camera shortcuts.
- **Release status:** these are next-version **candidates**, not silent changes to published v1.8.0. Follow exact-head Windows CI; keep Microsoft Store indefinitely paused per owner instruction. Data-scientific enhancements and multi-region simultaneous geometry still require independent validation.


### Integration reconciliation — 2026-10-08
- Combined PR #37 Data-owned 2D / Field-owned 3D root-cause fix with PR #38 full-width Ribbon and non-overlapping 3D comparison captions in `integration/foamlens-data-field-viewport-20261008`. Ribbon retains #38 compact camera actions, #37 comparison panel ownership and routes both 2D Compare entrypoints to that Data-owned card.
- Windows/WebView2 and private QuickCup scientific validations for this integration HEAD remain **pending** until CI confirms. Actual desktop screenshots and installed UX must not be presumed successful. Microsoft Store stays paused; no release triggered.

- FoamLens `AGENTS.md` and Copilot instructions no longer demand a protected pre-release human screenshot approval. Automated rendered UI checks stay mandatory; owner review remains **post-release**, per the current master `RENDERED_UI_RELEASE_GATE.md`.
- Connector-side syntax parsing of 10 affected JS/test modules and 9 focused integration invariants passed on the integration branch. These are structural checks only, **not** a substitute for actual Windows/QuickCup/native screenshots or installed-app functionality.


## 2026-10-08 — 1024px Field Ribbon clipping & failed-build visual evidence
- Packaged Windows smoke passed real Data↔Field ownership and Ribbon navigation, then caught Field toolbar overflow at 1024px: scrollWidth=1352 against clientWidth=1024. UI fault, not a testing false positive.
- Field main Ribbon uses accessible, bounded icon-only actions under 1460px; labels remain in DOM and on hover/accessibility metadata. At <=760px redundant quick-camera icons yield to the Camera subbar. Full controls remain reachable; scientific scene is not resized or obscured by a second toolbar row.
- CI now uploads visual screenshots and native smoke logs even on failure, without uploading duplicate binaries. Await real Windows 1024px geometry validation; do not merge/release until exact-head full checks succeed.

## 2026-10-08 — Multi-region FieldScene prototype (issue #40, development only)

- **Architecture:** added actual physical-region scene layers to the existing Field WebGL canvas. Every discovered complete physical mesh region is listed and enabled by default, with per-region visibility, field selectors, opacity, Show all / Only primary buttons; primary region retains existing probe/vector/slice controls. Regions are **not** conflated with OpenFOAM processor partitions.
- **Data integrity:** each secondary region loads its own mesh and field through the existing OpenFOAM association/time parser. Only explicitly matching physical frame times are colored; an unavailable secondary field renders a visibly labeled neutral geometry-only shell if a single reconstructed mesh exists. Unreconstructed processor-only fallback does not fabricate a surface and reports the gap. Surface-face data deliberately use neutral shells pending separate boundary-aware material support rather than falsely coloring by cells.
- **Rendering:** each region allocates independent position/color/edge WebGL buffers in the SAME canvas and depth buffer; GPU buffers are released on scene changes. Camera fit computes the union of visible physical meshes. Transparency currently follows the existing WebGL alpha/depth behavior and is **not** order-independent transparency; true translucent interface compositing remains a separate validation item.
- **Unit/integration scope:** checked JS syntax, six pure-model invariants for deduplicated physical regions, exact physical times, missing time, camera union and invalid bounds. Added three Node regression tests exercising scene identity, exact time and union fit. These are **not** native Windows screenshots, scientific OpenFOAM case validation or proof of installed-app usability.
- **Integration:** this development branch is stacked on PR #39. Do not merge it directly into main until #39 is incorporated and native CI checks this exact multi-region HEAD. No Store build or release requested.
- **Remaining:** build/launch/functional and actual multiregion OpenFOAM fixture tests; robust internal face coloring for surface associations; occlusion/transparency and probe selection across all regions; export/video exact-frame and per-region controls; large case memory/performance and cancellation. No assertion that all issue #40 acceptance criteria are satisfied.

- **Subsequent hardening:** limit asynchronous region parsers to two at a time, publish independent region layers progressively, and cancel stale uploads by case/frame generation checks. GPU allocation now fails explicitly; user-visible per-region readouts survive UI/language refresh.
- **Within-region processor fallback:** a missing field at a physical frame may show neutral geometry composed from processor partitions belonging to **that same physical region only**; duplicate reconstructed meshes, absent partition snapshots and invalid topology are reported rather than guessed.
- **Additional executed checks:** mock WebGL rendered two separate region layers in one GL context (four draw calls) and released all eight GPU buffers; a partition-only geometry mock reconstructed exactly the two `solid` processors without including a `fluid` processor. Source syntax rechecked after each change. These are model/mock checks, not native/physical-fixture acceptance.
- The stacked PR remains draft until exact-head Windows install/launch/Field smoke and realistic multi-region OpenFOAM tests pass. No release triggered.

- **Animation integrity hardening:** video exporter now waits for all physical-region layers of each frame; an unavailable visible region aborts export instead of silently delivering an incomplete image. Frame preload scans and fixes **independent per-region, per-field, per-component and per-dimension** color ranges across time, restoring interactive per-frame ranges afterward; failure cleanup resets scan state.
- **Verification:** six new, isolated multiregion regression tests were actually executed through a JS source/test harness and passed; frontend, animation module and test syntax compiled successfully. Additional mock WebGL and processor-region isolation checks passed. Full Node suite, real OpenFOAM data, packaged WebView2 visual pixel checks, installed Windows smoke, memory/occlusion and real video playback remain unverified; do not promote this PR from draft or claim the feature finished from these tests alone.


## 2026-10-08 — Owner's full unresolved UI/UX bug batch reopened and audited

- **Tracking:** issue #30 now lists ten acceptance conditions D01/D02/F01/F02/F03/R01/S01/A01/U01/Q01 for Data 2D/time profiles/probes/logs, physical 3D regions, second comparison view, toolbar/chrome, logo, About, social links and visual consistency.
- **Owner's screenshots override stale closure notes:** implementation or isolated JS tests do not prove a visible regression is fixed. PR #39 is unmerged; PR #41 is a draft stacked on #39.
- **Actual CI root causes:** the integration Windows job failed ribbon-ui.test.cjs due to outdated legacy Data click expectations; the Field branch failed isosurface.test.cjs due to a stale condition that ignored region visibility; section-ownership.test.cjs subsequently failed by matching whitespace/formatting instead of the real Data difference navigation behavior.
- **Corrections:** both PR branches now use the canonical Data action ID flRaDataTimeSeries in native ownership smoke and robust section ownership assertions; Ribbon checks the new canonical Data view navigation; the iso suite honors primary region visibility. All three complete regression suites were executed against fetched GitHub source with JS module mocks and passed (Ribbon, six iso checks, eight ownership checks).
- **Native acceptance expanded:** WebView2 smoke now checks persistent FoamLens product mark/name, About and Updates inside the full-width global header even after sidebar collapse; Probe/Clear must be docked in tools outside scientific viewport. Canonical branding unchanged.
- **Limits:** exact-head Windows Actions are still processing; no packaged native screenshot/real scientific fixture/large dataset usability may be claimed on the basis of JS checks. Microsoft Store remains paused; no release; Michel's human review is post-release, not a manual pre-release gate.


## 2026-10-08 — Multiregion visibility and frame resource ownership

- Corrected visible-only camera fit (hidden primary no longer expands bounds); targeted regression passed.
- All visible-region controls now go through one owned visibility manager. Hiding a physical region frees its own GPU buffers and invalidates pending loads. Showing it again requests its actual missing frame. Hidden secondary regions are not parsed or allocated at each timestep.
- Starting a new physical frame releases old secondary layers before the new primary field arrives, preventing silent cross-time composites during asynchronous updates.
- Added regression with mock GL allocations/deletions, checked union bounds of visible meshes only. Real packaged WebView2/QuickCup acceptance remains pending; no release.


## 2026-10-08 — Secondary physical-region face field mapping
- Region compositor now triangulates actual OpenFOAM internal faces when association=surface and exact face counts match. Colors use the actual indexed `internalField` face values and region-specific video range; never color unknown boundary patches as if they were measured.
- Neutral shell rendered translucently around colored internal faces; GPU face buffers freed on region hide, case change, timestep change or error. Invalid counts fall back to explicit neutral geometry, not synthetic data.
- Added dynamic V8 regression for 2-face fixture, real face index mapping, draw opacity, 6 GPU buffer allocations/releases. Runtime packaged Windows and a physical multiRegion fixture still required before release.

## 2026-10-08 — Sync to validated main and unified scientific opacity
- PR #39 merged into main after exact-head QuickCup and packaged/installed Windows CI passed. PR #41 preserved independent physical-region WebGL scene, exact-time/association field mapping, independent native smoke checks and all additional scientific regressions.
- Opaque surfaces still write depth; translucent outer shells and fields with interior/face rendering no longer block depth for other regions in the same scene. This is standard alpha blending, NOT order-independent transparency; a future rendered multiregion fixture must still validate occlusion and exact frame consistency.
- The integration commit has both branch head and main as parents; no release or Store publication.


## 2026-10-09 — Real packaged scientific multiregion acceptance
- Verified the private B13 QuickCup OpenFOAM fixture has BOTH `constant/metal/polyMesh` and `constant/mold/polyMesh` with complete points/faces/owner/neighbour, plus genuine `9.8/mold/T`; not synthetic meshes, not duplicated case identities.
- Windows portable and installed smoke now require `metal;mold` physical regions in the SAME case and single WebGL context. The smoke-only helper awaits all secondary real fields at the primary physical time, checks the T field, exact time, finite range, mesh ownership, positive cell/triangle counts, distinct meshes and shared GL context, failing closed if an imported region is missing or drawn as geometry-only. Actual composited pixels are saved as `visual/{portable,installed}/field-real-multiregion.png` for visual review.
- Added permanent regression to ensure this runtime fixture requirement cannot silently be removed. Full exact-head Windows CI pending; PR #41 remains draft; no release.


## 2026-10-09 — Unsplitted parent mesh is not an extra physical region
- Verified the real private B13 QuickCup case contains `constant/polyMesh` of its unsplit source and `constant/metal/polyMesh`, `constant/mold/polyMesh`. Only metal/mold have `0/` and `9.8/` physical fields; the unsplit parent is NOT a third simultaneous physical region.
- Region inventory now omits that root mesh only if named real regions exist AND root has no independent field-bearing time-series. It preserves genuinely field-bearing default regions. Added dynamic discovery test for both scenarios.
- Native installed-runtime multiregion acceptance checks both WebGL2 and WebGL context types, rather than rejecting an otherwise valid WebGL2 renderer. Re-run exact-head Windows fixture smoke; no release.


## 2026-10-09 — Visible outer mold and native test contract
- Fixed a stale regression assertion: Windows unit test expected a different native multiregion success-log string from the actual C# emission. The smoke itself had NOT run at that failed revision; no false scientific PASS claimed.
- Physical secondary layers now start visible but translucent (opacity 0.48) so a surrounding mold does not by default occlude the selected primary metal region. Primary opacity remains 1 and every user-edited region opacity remains independent. A dynamic V8 regression verifies both initially visible and correct alpha selection.
- Re-run installed portable + installer smoke requiring real B13 metal/mold fields, shared GL and captured composition. CI pending, PR #41 draft and unreleased.

## 2026-10-09 — Explicit Windows CI coverage for multiregion contract
- Added the new `desktop/tests/multiregion-release-contract.test.cjs` as an explicit `build` job step in `.github/workflows/build-foamlens-desktop.yml` (commit `2b00756`). Previously the test was committed but not executed by the workflow.
- Static readback confirmed the step exists immediately before the existing 3D Field View suite. Actual exact-head Windows run has **not** been observed or validated in this session.
- Connector `fetch_commit_workflow_runs` reports only pull-request-triggered runs; this workflow uses push and manual dispatch. An empty connector result must **not** be treated as proof that no push CI ran. Check Actions UI/API with unrestricted workflow run listing before claiming a CI block or PASS.
- `main` received separate shared-agent policy PR #42 after this branch's base; reconcile before merge. No merge or release performed.

## 2026-10-10 — Data Time Series Ribbon regression guard
- Issue #30 review found `desktop/tests/ribbon-ui.test.cjs` asserted retired identifier `flRaDataTime` using `source.includes`. That assertion passed accidentally because the real `flRaDataTimeSeries` contains the old string as a prefix.
- Updated the test to check the canonical `flRaDataTimeSeries` command, its actual Data Ribbon HTML creation and the `flRibbonOpenDataView('timeseries')` navigation binding. Also explicitly reject rebinding the retired command.
- Scope is regression-test hardening only; no UI or science implementation has changed. Exact-head Windows/QuickCup CI and native interactions remain pending. No release.
